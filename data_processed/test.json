ACUTE\/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Cholangitis # Strep spp. (likely Enterococcus) bacteremia # Adenocarcinoma pancreaticobiliary origin He presented with fever, jaundice, and mental status changes. RUQ US also showed persistent left intrahepatic biliary dilation and gallbladder sludge despite the presence of CBD stent, suggesting that the stent was non-functioning\/occluded or there was some other source of obstruction. The CBD brushing cytology from his prior ERCP was non-diagnostic. He had no apparent mass in the head of the pancreas on imaging but there remained some concern for a primary pancreatobiliary tumor so he was planned to have a repeat ERCP and EUS the week he was admitted. Blood culture at ___ is growing Strep spp. He was treated with Unasyn for cholangitis as well as Strep bacteremia. BCx here grew Strep anginosus. He had an ERCP on ___ with removal of the old stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm malignant-appearing stricture of the distal CBD. Cytology brushings were sampled. EUS was completed on which they visualized a 1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the distal CBD. FNB was performed x3. Pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: PATIENT SUMMARY: ================ ___ male with PMH of CAD s\/p drug-eluting stent in ___, sick sinus syndrome status post pacemaker in ___, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, and CLL who presented with midsternal chest pain and diffuse ST-segment elevations consistent with pericarditis. #CORONARIES: Mid LAD stent #PUMP: >55% #RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ACUTE ISSUES: ============ #CHEST PAIN #PERICARDITIS Patient presented with ___ mid-sternal chest pain. Patient's troponins were negative X4 and d-dimer also negative which provided reassurance of non-ACS and non-PE event. Recreation of patient's chest pain with palpation of his chest wall was initially thought to be most consistent with a costochondritis. However, EKG obtained upon admission showed diffuse ST elevations consistent with pericarditis and the patient was treated empirically for pericarditis. TTE showed a trivial pericardial effusion and preserved global left ventricular systolic function with a mildly dilated aortic sinus. As the patient was unable to receive NSAIDs due to known CAD and questionable GI bleed on last admission, he was started on colchicine and prednisone. This combination improved his chest pain overall, though he continued to have occasional episodes of midsternal pain leading up to discharge. These episodes were all self-limiting and were not associated with any new EKG changes or troponin elevations. The patient underwent a stress test to ensure no ischemic disease. He had no anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes during the pharmacological stress and myocardial perfusion was normal. The patient will be discharged on colchicine (0.6 mg BID) and a prednisone taper. ___ Patient's creatinine bumped from 1.1 on admission to 2.2 on ___. Patient had been NPO prior to myocardial perfusion study and the etiology of the ___ was thought to be pre-renal. This was supported by urine electrolytes studies which revealed a urine Na < 20 and urine Cl also < 20, consistent with sodium avid state. The patient was treated with a 1.5 liter fluid bolus and his creatinine rapidly downtrended. The patient's creatinine was 1.2 on discharge. #DM Patient's blood sugars were monitored closely during this admission. He initially was very poorly controlled with blood sugars in the mid ___. This was likely due to a delay in restarting his home dose of Lantus 75 units BID (he had been initially placed on 50 units BID). Metformin was held on admission and the patient was placed on a sliding scale short acting insulin in addition to above metformin. Given the patient's need for 2 weeks of prednisone therapy to treat his pericarditis, ___ was consulted to provide input regarding adequate glucose control while on steroids during this time. The ___ team recommended adding 5 units of Homolog with a Humalog pen before meals. This dose was deemed appropriate to help control blood sugars while on prednisone and also safe enough to be continued after the steroid taper has finished. #Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Patient in sinus rhythm upon admission. The patient's home metoprolol was continued for rate control. The patient's home rivaroxaban was 10 mg. Unclear why patient on this dose but he has been maintained on 10 mg daily since at least the end of ___. Given the patient's normal kidney function at baseline, the dose was increased to 20 mg daily prior to discharge in order to ensure adequate anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. CHRONIC ISSUES: ============== #CLL Patient presented with leukocytosis to 25.6 the setting of his underlying CLL. He takes ibrutinib as an outpatient which has been controlling his symptoms. This medication was unfortunately not on formulary at ___. His wife was able to bring in his home ibrutinib to take while hospitalized. Acyclovir was continued at his home dose. #CHRONIC PAIN Patient is taking a number of medications at home to treat chronic pain in the shoulders as well as in his back. We continued all of these medications while he is in the hospital. #HYPOTHYROIDISM Continued home levothyroxine #INSOMNIA Continued home ramelteon, trazodone, ziprasidone #HLD Continued home atorvastatin and fenofibrate. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ================== Patient hospitalized for chest pain without evidence of ischemic disease. Troponin and stress test both unremarkable. EKG notable for diffuse STE consistent with presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic acute pericarditis. Patient placed on prednisone taper rather than NSAIDs given history of CAD and possible history of GIB. He was also started on colchicine which will be continued as an outpatient. Patient seen by ___ team for better blood sugar control and they recommended starting 5 units of Humalog before meals. Rivaroxaban dose increased to 20 mg daily from 10 mg daily given no contraindication to do so and 10 mg subtherapeutic anticoagulation for patient's with atrial fibrillation. Needs to have CBC monitored closely after discharge to make sure H\/H stable on higher dose. NEW MEDICATIONS: - Homolog pen 5 units prior to meals - Colchicine 0.6 mg PO\/NG BID for 3 months - Prednisone taper as follows: 40 mg daily on the day of discharge, and the following day (___), then 30 mg daily for 3 days, then 20 mg daily for 3 days, then 10 mg daily for 3 days, then off CHANGED MEDICATIONS: - Rivaroxaban changed from 10 mg daily to 20 mg daily STOPPED MEDICATIONS: - None RELEVANT LAB VALUES ON DISCHARGE: ================================= WBC: 15.4 HgB: 9.0 Cre: 1.2 BUN: 33 Na: 127 Glu: 302 CONTACT: ___ (son): ___ CODE STATUS: Full","summary":"You came to the hospital because of chest pain in the center of your chest.

EKGs demonstrated prolonged PR with dropped QRS indicating possible second degree type 1 heart block. Her rhythm transitioned to complete heart block, but she remained asymptomatic and normotensive. It again changed back to 2:1 block before converting back to sinus rhythm. Heart rates were stable > 60 on discharge. #Systolic Heart Failure EF 20%: The patient has a history of non ischemic cardiomyopathy with baseline EF ___. A TTE at ___ demonstrated stable ventricular function EF=205. She was not volume overloaded appearing on exam, so home diuretics were held. ___: The patient's baseline Cr. is 1.2 per outside record, was increased to 1.3 on admission. The small increase may be simple due to normal lab variation or from cardiac cath contrast. Creatinine was monitored daily. #Leukocytosis: She also had an elevated WBC on admission, likely in the setting of MI stress induced. There were no signs of infection and the patient remained afebrile. CBC was trended daily. #Elevated LFTs at OSH: AST\/ALT were measured to be 273\/40 in setting of ACS. No signs of volume overload to suggest congestive hepatopathy. Given history of HLD and DM, NAFLD also a possibility. #Microcytic Anemia: Hgb 10 on admission with iron studies at outside hospital suggestive of chronic iron deficiency anemia. #DMII: The patient was placed on ISS while in house. #HTN: The patient's home BP meds were initially held due to concern for heart block and normotensive BPs. #HLD: She was continued on home rosuvastatin 40mg daily. #Chronic Pain: She was continued on home tramadol and Tylenol. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ==================== [ ] Please review all medication changes. [ ] Patient was started on DAPT (clopidogrel and aspirin) given ___ in RCA. She should continue uninterrupted clopidogrel use for at least ___ year. [ ] Patient previously on digoxin although indication unclear. Was held in acute setting. Decision to restart at the discretion of primary cardiologist. [ ] Patient previously on spironolactone that was held in the acute setting. It should be restarted within 1 week of discharge with follow-up labs to ensure stable potassium. [ ] Patient not on ACE inhibitor ___ despite EF of 20%. This was not started given hyperkalemia and presumed intolerability. Should be on ___ if the patient can tolerate it. Decision to start at the discretion of primary cardiologist. [ ] Please continue to uptitrate metoprolol with target HR of 60. [ ] Patient will need follow-up with EP regarding ICD placement given her current HFrEF (20%). [ ] Patient should have follow-up labs (CHEM10) on ___ and should be faxed to her primary cardiologist Dr. ___ (___). Script was provided to patient. [] Patient will need ICD implantation post discharge [] Consider Fe supplementation [] Consider Hepatitis serologies given elevated LFTs # CODE: FULL CODE # CONTACT\/HCP: ___: ___ ___: ___","summary":"You came to the hospital because you were having chest pain. We did tests that showed you were having a heart attack. You underwent a procedure called a cardiac catheterization which showed a blockage in one of the vessels that brings blood to your heart which was the cause of your heart attack. A stent was placed to keep the blood vessel open. Your hospital course was complicated by a slow heart rate which is often seen after the type of heart attack you had. We started you on medications called blood thinners to prevent the stent placed in your heart from getting clogged. It is very important that you take this medicine every day. We also gave you medicines to prevent another heart attack."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with complicated PMH notable for CAD s\/p multiple PCI, systolic CHF (LVEF 35% in ___, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer, and recent admission for stabilization of atraumatic left femur fracture, now re-admitted from rehab for exertional angina during physical therapy. # Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: Patient readmitted with anginal chest pain, brought on by exertion & relieved with nitroglycerin. ECG without evidence of acute ischemia\/infarction, but serial cardiac biomarkers showed mild new elevation in troponin-T peaking 2 days after chest pain episode. He was started on long-acting nitrate (Imdur 30 mg daily). He did have one chest pain episode in-house which resolved with 1 tab SL TNG. He underwent adenosine nuclear stress test (H\/O intolerance to both Persantine and dobutamine), which showed new severe inferolateral and moderate anterolateral fixed defects, interval worsening moderate inferior wall fixed defect, and global hypokinesis LVEF decreased to 25% (from 35% in ___. Given the absence of objective evidence of a large area of ischemia (rather than prior infarct, as documented) and the small troponin elevation, conservative medical therapy was pursued rather than invasive risk stratification with coronary angiography. He was continued on his home medications: aspirin, metoprolol (at recently increased dose), Lipitor, dabigatran. Plavix was not started given bleeding risk (H\/O radiation proctitis plus admission 6 mos ago for BRBPR). # Chronic systolic heart failure with acute diastolic exacerbation, LVEF 25%: Last TTE in ___ demonstrated moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Pharmacological MIBI showed interval worsening heart failure, LVEF decreased to 25% with increase LV cavity size, all likely due to silent infarcts at home during the intervening ___ years, since MIBI also showed extension of prior infarcts and new infarcts in an LAD distribution. During this admission, he appeared euvolemic for several days, with no evidence ___ or pulmonary edema. He then developed asymmetric ___ edema after receiving small amount IVF on ___ (asymmetry likely due to recent left hip surgery, ___ negative for DVT). This ___ edema was likely dependent edema after being up to a chair for many hours. The patient should have his legs elevated while in bed or sitting in chair and should wear compression stockings. He was continued on home metoprolol. We note that he is not on Lasix or an ACE-I (despite his diabetes and CAD); starting ACE-I as an outpatient should be considered once renal function normalizes (as BP tolerates). # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On Pradaxa for anticoagulation plus metoprolol for rate control, which were continued. HR trended ___, no episodes RVR. # Recent aspiration pneumonia: On admission, patient was midway through a treatment course of levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia, which he completed on ___. CTA chest showed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for aspiration pneumonitis. Patient gave history of feeling he was swallowing his own saliva. Speech and swallow service performed bedside evaluation, suggested patient's diet be restricted to nectar-thickened liquids, soft solids, and pills crushed in applesauce. They also recommended video swallow, which we requested to be performed in rehab. # Chronic kidney disease: Patient has H\/O chronic kidney disease; review of ___ years of creatinine levels show baseline 1.2 - 1.5. Cr was 1.1 on admission; rose to 1.3 by the follow morning (likely due to contrast load received for CTA chest), then normalized thereafter but worsened in the setting of volume overload. Urine lytes showed low urine Na, which could be due to either pre-renal physiology and\/or worsening congestive heart failure, as above. # S\/P left femoral hemi-arthroplasty: Patient had been discharged to rehab for <24 hours. He had previously been hospitalized on the medicine service where he underwent left hemiarthroplasty by ortho for atraumatic (suspected pathologic) left femur fracture, concerning for possible involvement of treated prostate cancer -- pathology returned negative. He worked with ___ during this admission. Ortho follow-up discharge appointments arranged (see below). Patient had repeat hip X-ray here, which was unchanged from prior, no acute fracture. # Incidental Chest CT Finding: Bilateral lung nodules, sclerotic lesions rib and clavicle: Findings noted on CTA chest obtained on admission. Concerning for possible metastic disease, especially given recent atraumatic left femur fracture. Lung nodules need surveillance imaging in 3 months. Patient was re-scheduled for heme-onc follow-up including review of pathology from recent intra-operative left femur bone biopsy obtained during last admission. # Depression\/Grief: Patient noted to be suffering from depression and grief over his wife's recently-diagnosed terminal pancreatic cancer. Social work followed during this admission. Psychiatry consulted for repeated expressions of passive suicidality to nursing staff; they felt patient was suffering significantly but was not an imminent threat to himself. Both psychiatry and social work recommended ongoing therapy, which patient accepted only after significant encouragement but seemed to appreciate. He was not interested in pharmacotherapy. Ongoing therapy at rehab and beyond was recommended for coping with his grief. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. Angina - monitor for symptoms, use of SL NG, consider long-acting nitrate dose increase to 60 mg as BP tolerates. 2. CHF - Patient not on ACE-I on admission, none started given acute renal failure but should be revisited in cardiology follow-up. 3. RECENT LEFT HIP ARTHROPLASTY- has ortho f\/u wwith films. Patient concerned about \"clicking sounds\" but left hip films here unchanged. Please discuss with patient what to expect in terms of rehabilitation, functional status & timeline. 4. HEME\/ONC - follow-up imaging findings demonstrating chest wall lytic\/sclerotic lesions, as well as bilateral lung nodules. ___ need further onc follow-up given hx of prostate cancer. 5. GRIEF\/DEPRESSION - ongoing difficulties coping with his own & wife's medical diagnoses. Needs therapist and\/or pharmacologic management. 6. SUSPECTED OSTEOPOROSIS (per last discharge summary) - Patient needs review of possible osteoporosis and initiation of bisphosphonate; Ca\/Vitamin D already started. 7. SPEECH & SWALLOW - Monitor for aspiration, NEEDS VIDEO SWALLOW EVALUATION.","summary":"Labs showed that you had an NSTEMI (heart muscle injury), which caused detectable low-level release of heart muscle enzymes. We kept you in the hospital for a stress test, to assess blood flow in your coronary arteries. It showed heart muscle injury which was not reversible, so we opted not to proceed to cardiac catheterization. While you were here, you were seen by orthopedic surgeons who evaluated your recent surgical wound. You also continued to work with physical therapy. The social worker and psychiatrist both recommended you continue to receive therapy at rehab, to have an outlet to discuss your ongoing frustration and grief over your own medical issues and your wife's recent diagnosis."}

ACUTE\/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: #Lightnededness Patient had been experiencing lightheadedness when she stands up or sits down but not at rest. She has experienced 5 episodes in the past 2 months and has gone to the hospital each time. It is not associated with any other precipitating factors. Most likely due to moderate-severe AS (mean aortic gradient 41mmHg and ___ .7cm2 found on TTE on ___. Endocrine factors contributing to lightheadedness have been ruled out with normal thyroid (x2 TSH) and normal aldosterone levels. Neurologic etiology less likely given negative MRA\/MRI at ___ and arrhythmias less likely given none noted on any of her previous admissions. #Severe aortic stenosis Worsening AS found on TTE in ___ compared to ___ of this year, as well as more frequent symptoms. Patient is ___ however is otherwise healthy and is independent and should be able to tolerate procedure. Catheterization performed in anticipation of TAVR. She was seen by our cardiothoracic surgeons who reported she is high risk for SAVR. #Longstanding leukopenia Low wbc present as far back as ___ in ___ records.

She is currently on 2 mg qd, but this has varied over time. She had an unremarkable abdominal ultrasound in ___, without splenomegaly. The chronic leukopenia could be from PMR or chronic steroids, although seems unlikely per hematology consult. Peripheral smear (reviewed by hematologist) showed mild aniso and poikylocytosis with occ pencil forms (c\/w iron def), decreased wbc without any early or abnormal forms, normal platelets. Patient's longstanding neutropenia is likely idiopathic and not worrisome. #Chronic Iron deficiency anemia, per patient, she has known about for several years. She has been unable to tolerate oral iron due to constipation. Stools allegedly negative for blood, and her weight is stable. Received IV iron here. CHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS: #PMR - Continue home prednisone 2 mg daily #Secondary hyperaldosteronism Found to have aldosterone\/renin ratio of 171 and adrenal adenoma on CT. Aldosterone levels normal. Unlikely pheo. #Resistant HTN Workup at ___ included TSH, aldosterone, renin levels as well as renal artery u\/s. TSH was normal, and aldosterone level was normal but renin moderately low (ratio 171), consistent with secondary hyperaldosteronism. CT showed adrenal adenoma to explain the aldosterone level. Renal U\/S showed 60% renal artery stenosis on right, possibly due to AS and peripheral vasoconstiction. Pheochromocytoma was thought to be unlikely so urine metanephrines were not sent.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with HTN, COPD (2L home O2), with recent admission for hypoxic respiratory failure with course complicated by new-onset cardiomyopathy thought to be stress-induced, referred from her PCP's office with ECG changes and chest pain. EKG with diffuse TWI in V2-V6 and patient had epigastric pain, severe, but similar to her ___ pain. She had bilateral lower extremity edema and her proBNP was elevated (but lower than during her hospitalization). She responded well to Lasix 40mg IV x 1. Her trops were negative and once she got to the floor her EKG changes actually resolved. Heart catheterization on ___ revealed no significant CAD, but presence of an intramyocardial bridge over the LAD. Her chest pain and EKG changes likely due to coronary vs esophageal vasopasm. We started Imdur 30mg daily on admission, but this was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed that her EF normalized (60%). Her dilitiazem (discontinued on last admission) was restarted on discharge. # ECG Changes \/ Diffuse TWI Her ECG findings are most likely secondary to coronary and\/or esophageal vasospasm. The patient's pain resolved with morphine and had three negative troponins. EKG changes resolved once patient arrived on floor. Imdur 30 mg was added initially for the pain and ECG changes. Cardiac catheterization on ___ showed no significant coronary artery disease but myocardial bridge of LAD. Imdur was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed that her EF normalized (60%) and her dilitiazem (discontinued on last admission) was restarted on discharge. # Stress-induced cardiomyopathy Patient recently discharged with new EF reduction to 35%, thought to be most consistent with a stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient had continued the regimen on which she was recently discharged, including furosemide 20mg daily. She appeared volume overloaded on admission and received IV lasix x1. She was trialed on 40 mg PO lasix daily, however, due to hypotension, this was reduced to prior dose of 20 mg daily. Due to distribution of T-wave changes on EKG, it was thought that her cardiomyopathy may have been ischemic. Cardiac catheterization on ___ showed no significant coronary artery disease but intramyocardial bridge over LAD. Repeat TTE on ___ showed normalization of her EF to 60%. She continued home aspirin and losartan, but metoprolol was discontinued. Previous home diltiazem was restarted on discharge due to normal EF. She was kept on 20 mg furosemide daily, as she likely has component of diastolic heart failure. She did not appear volume overloaded on discharge. # GERD \/ ___ Esophagus Last EGD ___ with diffuse gastritis and evidence of ___. Symptoms on admission were suggestive of esophageal vasospasm, which may account for diffuse TWI. She continued home PPI and was started on imdur 30 mg daily, but this was discontinued on discharge. Home diltiazem (discontinued on previous admission due to depressed EF) was restarted on discharge after TTE revealed normalization of EF to 60%. # Hyponatremia Chronic based on her labs, and at her baseline around 131. Has been previously attributed to SIADH which was again considered during her last hospitalization as her sodium saw no improvement with either fluid administration or diuresis. Sodium remained stable. # Hypertension History of hypertension, previously on diltiazem. This was discontinued after her last hospitalization. She continued her home losartan. Diltiazem restarted on discharge. # COPD: On home O2 since prior hospitalization. Long term smoker. She was started on tiotropium on day of discharge for presumed COPD. She reported that she has outpatient PFTs scheduled. # Anemia, normocytic: Patient with history of normocytic anemia since ___, with baseline HCT between ___. She was previously anemic in ___, but had normal H\/H most recently in ___. Iron studies during this admission were suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation. # Bladder Spasm: She continued home oxybutynin. # Right hip pain Thought to be due to known spinal stenosis and chronic right hip pain. She continued home acetaminophen, lidocaine patches. Transitional Issues: ==================== - patient started on tiotropium for possible COPD; needs outpatient PFTs - patient needs electrolyte check at her PCP appointment on ___ - diltiazem extended release 180 mg daily was restarted on discharge due to resolution of her cardiomyopathy - patient kept on furosemide 20 mg daily as she most likely has some diastolic heart failure - discharge weight: 55 kg","summary":"___ came to the hospital for changes in your EKG. ___ had a heart catheterization that showed no significant blockages in the arteries of your heart, but rather a piece of heart muscle that may compress once of the arteries in your heart. Spasm of this artery may have caused the changes seen on EKG. ___ also had an ultrasound of your heart, which showed dramatic improvement of your heart's pumping function compared to prior."}
