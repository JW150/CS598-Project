{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman s\/p Roux-en-Y ___ years ago with h\/o nutritional deficiencies, Behcet syndrome, hypothyroidism, depression and chronic pain, who presented with nausea, vomiting, RUQ pain, and weight loss. # FAILURE TO THRIVE: Presented with ongoing weight loss and very poor ability to tolerate PO, reportedly eating only 2 6-oz yogurts daily. Failure to thrive was thought largely nutritional in setting of this very poor PO intake. However she is on significant opiate regimen which was thought to contribute as well both from standpoint of GI motility and mental status. Opiates were downtitrated as below with some improvement. # NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Patient with chronic post-prandial nausea\/vomiting. Imaging was remarkable only for biliary dilatation (see below) with no evidence of obstruction or other etiology of nausea\/vomiting. She underwent EGD to evaluate her anastomosis; this was normal. Nausea\/vomiting thought likely multifactorial due in part to high dose opiate use and decreased GI motility, as well as inability to tolerate large volumes of food s\/p Roux en Y. Opiates decreased, she was seen by nutrition, and was tolerating POs well prior to discharge. Recommend consideration of referral for bypass revision if nausea\/vomiting continues. # BILIARY DILATATION: Patient presented with intermittent postprandial RUQ pain and significant RUQ tenderness on exam. She is s\/p remote cholecystectomy. CT identified significant biliary dilatation which could not be further elucidated with MRCP given that patient has retained pain pump catheter in intrathecal space. RUQ ultrasound identified area concerning for periampullary mass. EUS was done but did not visualize any such mass. Patient will follow up with her PCP and GI. COmparison with prior imaging and consideration of repeat imaging to determine if any interval change is recommended. # NARCOTIC USE FOR CHRONIC PAIN: Patinet with long standing chronic pain of somewhat unclear etiology as well as high dose opioid use with recent dose increases correlating to time course of her FTT. Fentanyl patch was decreased from 100 to 75 mcg\/h. REcommend considering further decrease on discharge, as well as pain clinic referral. # CONCERN FOR HORNER'S SYNDROME: Patient with left sided Horner's syndrome on exam, also with decline of mental status. Was seen by neurology who recommend CTA head\/neck and CT of upper chest. THese were unremarkable except for ___ cerebral atrophy. Recommend outpatient follow up\/neuropsychiatric testing. # S\/P ROUX EN Y: Continued B vitamin, MVI. Labs here revealed slightly low B2 and otherwise no deficiencies. # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH normal here. Continued home synthroid. # DEPRESSION: Somewhat poor mood without SI. Continued home fluoxetine, trazodone. # CODE: FULL # CONTACT: Partner ___ ___, daughter ___ ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [ ] Will need careful review of prior CT scans from ___ and ___. [ ] Biliary dilation is likely benign post Roux-en-Y changes. If prior scans show no biliary dilation, however, then can consider single balloon to evaluate ampulla and further surveillance imaging to rule out mass. [ ] Consider repeat CT in future to trend biliary dilatation\/rule out enlarging mass lesion. [ ] Fentanyl patch decreased to 75 mcg. Recommend considering decreasing opioid regimen, possible pain clinic referral, to minimize opioid dosing given c\/f contribution to hypotension and decreased motility. [ ] Consider neuropsychiatric testing as outpatient given e\/o cerebral atrophy on CT. [ ] Consider referral to surgery if patient still unable to tolerate po to consider reversal of Roux en Y. [ ] Please follow pending pathology on colonic polyp. [ ] Consider monitoring QTc as outpatient given ongoing use of Zofran and mildly prolonged QTc here.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because of your ongoing abdominal pain, vomiting, and weight lossYou were followed closely by the GI doctors. ___ had a CT of your abdomen which showed dilation of the bile ducts. ___ had an upper endoscopy, right upper quadrant ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, and colonoscopy.

With regards to the urinary symptoms, she was found to have a UTI, and was started on antibiotics with improvement, with plan for completion of 7-day course of ciprofloxacin. With regards to the confusion concerning for hepatic encephalopathy, this was assessed and felt most likely to be precipitated by the urinary infection. Her mental status cleared with initiation of lactulose\/rifaximin, and she was discharged with plan for continued lactulose therapy to reduce the chance of future episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. With regards to the paracentesis site, it was no longer leaking upon arrival to the floor. It was monitored closely and her abdomen was assessed by ___ for tappable pocket given concern for possible SBP, with small pocket of straw-colored fluid obtained. The fluid analyses showed evidence of portal HTN (SAAG 2.5), low total protein (0.9), and negative neutrophil criteria for SBP (PMNs 235), without any culture growth to date at the time of discharge. ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== #Decompensated EtOH cirrhosis c\/b volume refractory ascites #Concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis The patient has a history of refractory ascites secondary to her cirrhosis which has historically required frequent LVP (~5L, ___.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old woman HTN and depression who presented with abdominal pain, fever, N\/V that developed after screening colonoscopy with biopsy. #Abdominal pain s\/p colonoscopy: On admission, the patient was noted to be febrile and tachycardic. CXR and CT abdomen did not reveal any free air. However, she was noted to have massive colonic edema at the hepatic flexure. This was thought to be due to a microperforation after random biopsy from colonoscopy. There was no anion gap, and her lactate was normal. She was made NPO, and she initially received aggressive pain management with IV diluadid. Stool studies were negative for infection, she was started on a 10 day course of Cipro\/Flagyl given likely microperforation of the colon. Her diet was advanced slowly until she was able to tolerate a regular diet. She was also started on loperamide for her diarrhea with improvement in her symptoms. At discharge, her abd pain had significantly improved and she was no longer requiring pain medications. Her diarrhea had also improved and she was able to stay well hydrate without IV fluids. #Headache: Patient had multiple episodes of headache this admission, similar to her headaches at home. She was given Fioricet with improvement in her symptoms. No concerning neurological findings, likely tension headaches. #HTN: Her home diltiazem was held on admission given her somewhat low blood pressure. She continued to remain normotensive and we held her diltiazem at discharge, this can be restarted as an outpatient if indicated. #Depression: She appeared profoundly depressed during much of this admission, although she denied SI. She is followed closely by an outpatient therapist and also sees a psychiatrist. She was continued on her home trazodone, nefazodone and desvenlafaxine. We noted that she was on 3 serotonergic medications, she had no symptoms to suggest serotonin syndrome and her psych meds are all managed by her psychiatrist. ___ swelling: During this admission, the patient was noted to have RLE swelling, which was chronic, and ___ showed no evidence of DVT. She was on pneumoboots for the first three days of admission, given the recent colonoscopic biopsies, and she was then transitioned to subcutaneous heparin. Transitions of care: - follow up ultrasound of right adnexal lesion seen on CT - follow up blood cultures, which were pending at the time of discharge - will continue on 4 more days of Cipro\/Flagyl as an outpatient - consider restarting diltiazem for blood pressure as an outpatient, held this admission and at discharge - will follow-up with her PCP and gastroenterologist after d\/c","summary":"You were recently admitted to ___ with fevers, abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting soon after a colonoscopy. While you were here, you had a CT scan of the abdomen which showed inflammation of your colon. We believe this was caused by a small tear in the wall of your colon that occured after a biopsy was taken from the colonoscopy. The treatment is generally a slowly advanced diet and pain management, which you recieved. We have also started you on antibiotics which you will continue after discharge."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ was admitted to the cardiology service. Her CXR on admission showed likely worsening pulmonary edema on a background of ILD. Given lack of focal infiltrate, leucocytosis, and fever, abx were stopped. Steroids or other immunsupression were held at the recommendation of her primary pulmonologist. She was diuresed with IV lasix. Right and left heart cath was done and showed no obstructive CAD, elevated PCWP, and MVA 1.23cm2. Repeat TTE showed normal EF and moderate mitral stenosis, but was a limited study given body habitus. It was felt that she may benefit from mitral valuloplasty as mitral stenosis was the best explanation for her recurrent CHF and elevated wedge pressures. During her time on the cardiology floor, she was satting high ___ on ___, which the patient uses at home, and appeared to be breathing comfortably. TEE was done to look for evidence of thrombus. In the cath lab on ___ while attepmting valvuloplasty, when crossing the wire transeptally, there was entry into the aorta. The case was aborted, and the patient was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring. . The patient had a TTE post-procedure that showed no pericardial effusion or changes in the aorta. She remained hemodynamically stable overnight in the CCU. She continued to be diuresed with lasix. Her insulin sliding scale was uptitrated for hyperglycemia. The arterial and venous sheaths were removed from her groin the following day. Repeat TTE demonstrated no interval changes with no pericardial effusions. She was called back out to the cardiology floor. CXR Pa\/Lat was ordered for AM after call-out both to assess fluid status and to better evaluate possibility of underlying infectious process. Repeat CXR was much improved without pulmonary edema. Decision was made to take pt back for valvuloplasty on ___. Procedure was successful and without complication; gradient improved (see ECHO and procedure report for full details). Pt's clinical status was monitored for an additional day and lasix was titrated.

Discharge Cr: 1.7 Discharge Weight: 168.21 lb (76.3 kg) Discharge Diuretic: Furosemide 10 mg daily Discharge Hgb: 8.1 ACUTE ISSUES: ============= #Bradycardia The patient presented with bradycardia in the setting of electrolyte disturbance and acidosis as transfer from ___ ___. Reportedly at the OSH her ECG was concerning for possible atrial fibrillation w\/ complete heart block and both atropine and transcutaneous pacing were attempted prior to transfer. Of note, on arrival to ___ she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation w\/ slow ventricular response and rates ___. Sequence of causality is unclear: ie, if patient was bradycardic leading to decreased renal perfusion and thus an acidosis or if patient was acidotic due to renal failure (or other cause) leading to bradycardia. However, given lack of other end organ damage, more likely the latter. Her troponins were negative so unlikely to be ischemic in etiology. She is on high doses of metoprolol and Diltiazem at home and denies taking more medications than prescribed. On arrival, the pt was briefly on a dopamine drip. In this setting, her metoprolol and dilitiazem were held and her metoprolol was slowly reintroduced. Her Bradycardia resolved. #Pulmonary Hypertension The patient had evidence of volume overload with elevated JVP and lower extremity edema consistent with right sided heart failure exacerbation. However with diuresis, the patient became orthostatic. RHC showed severe pulmonary hypertension. Likely group III iso oxygen dependent COPD but evaluation for other causes was recommended by pulmonary. Group I work up included ___, ANCA, CCP, anti-centromere pending at time of discharge, C3: 110, C4: 23, RF: <10, anti-RNP: negative, HIV: negative. She is s\/p RUQUS with doppler for portopulmonary HTN: No evidence of porto-pulmonary HTN. Group III work up: was unable to acquire full PFTs - (spirometry, DLCO, lung volumes), has appointment on ___. A Non con CT chest: demonstrated emphysema. Regarding group IV workup, a VQ scan was performed without evidence of PE. #HFpEF Patient with new diagnosis of HFpEF with evidence of right-sided HF likely secondary to COPD given elevated RV pressures on her TTE, right axis deviation\/low limb lead voltage on her EKG. She is chronically on 3L but had an increased oxygen requirement intitially. She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix but this was ultimately held given mild ___. TTE this admission notable for RV dilation w free wall hypokinesis. She was diuresed with IV Lasix transitioned to torsemide. Held ACEi in the setting of ___. Received metoprolol as above, continued to hold diltiazem. Imdur was discontinued given absence of angina. Continued with IV Lasix lead to orthostatic hypotension and RHC was done to evaluate for volume overload. PCWP was normal at 10 and CI was normal at 2.82. PA pressure was ___ (47) consistent for severe pulmonary hypertension as above. At discharge, diuretic was her home dose of furosemide 10mg PO. #Atrial Fibrillation CHADS2VASC of 5 on warfarin. INR supratherapeutic on admission, initially held diltiazem and metoprolol iso of bradycardia. High doses of AV nodal blocking agents suggest that she has difficult to control rates. She had intermittent bouts of AF w\/ RVR to 150s while her nodal agents were being held. We restarted her metoprolol and uptitrated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6H (her home dose of metop) and consolidated to 100mg succinate prior to discharge. Anticoagulation was continued with warfarin 3 mg after correction of coagulopathy. #Coagulopathy On arrival pt's INR was supratherapeutic to 6.0 with prolonged PTT and decreasing platelets. Possibly in the setting of congestive hepatopathy vs. due to changes in her PO intake prior to arrival. She was given PO vitamin K for three days, w\/ normalization of her INR. Fibrinogen normal, blood smear showed 1+ schistocytes. Warfarin was restarted as above. #Iron Deficiency Anemia Pt w\/ Hgb ___ this admission. Required intermittent pRBC. Her iron studies are consistent w\/ Fe deficiency anemia (Ferritin 31, TIBC 300, Fe 17). Stool guaiac positive, but brown. Likely slow lower GI bleed iso supratherapeutic INR. INR reversed with vitamin K and Hgb stabilized. She should undergo EGD and a colonoscopy as an outpatient, but had adamantly refused inpatient evaluation. She received IV iron repletion x3 days. #Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with non anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis. Bicarbonate is chronically around 18 but ph was 7.16 on presentation. Non anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure from worsening heart failure or injury due to hypotensive event. She required small quantities of bicarb initially before her pH normalized. Renal was consulted while she was inpatient and improved without intervention. ___ on CKD: Patient has been seen by nephrologist with workup notable for negative spep, upep. Baseline creatinine in ___ ~1.5. Give exertional dyspnea, lower extremity dyspnea, and volume overload, likely pre-renal from decreased effective circulatory volume. Cr was 2.8 on admission and improved initially with diuresis. Diuresis was restarted with increase in Cr. on discharge Cr was 1.7. #Positive blood cultures #Leukocytosis #Possible Cellulitis She was briefly on vancomycin for possible GPC bactermia, but given speciation as CoNS only in one bottle, suspect this may have been contaminant. She had a full infectious workup which was negative and we transitioned her to Keflex to complete a 5 day course for cellulitis (___).

[] Recommend follow up with a pulmonologist (she preferred to see a provider closer to home as outpatient follow up in ___ will be challenging for her to keep.) If possible outpatient follow-up should involve a local Pulmonologist (at ___) and PH specialist at ___. She has had relatively extensive pulmonary hypertension workup however still needs PFTs. We have scheduled an appointment for her on ___ at ___ with a pulmonary hypertension specialist. [] Recommend referral to a cardiologist given her bradycardia with heart block on admission and further titration of nodal blockers. [] Few small lung nodules measuring up to at most 4 mm. These are very likely benign, but noting emphysema may be appropriate to consider follow-up chest CT for surveillance in ___ year. [] Pt w\/ iron deficiency anemia this admission w\/ Hgb ___. Her stool was guaic positive, but pt did not have any BRBPR or melena, so suspecting slow ooze. She was repleted with IV iron. Consider EGD\/Colonscopy as an outpatient. [] Consider transition from colesevelam to a statin. [] Consider continuing iron repletion as an outpatient. [] Diuretic management: she was discharged on lasix 10mg PO with notable lower extremity edema, further attempts at diuresis were made during her hospital course with worsening of her kidney function, absent of resolution of her edema and orthostasis. [] INR management: She was supratherapeutic with INR of 6 on admission please continue to monitor INR closely on discharge. She was ultimately continued on her home dose of 3 mg daily. [] Reduced allopurinol to every other day dosing due to decreased CrCl, if Cr improves can consider increasing dose. [] Monitor BP.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with h\/o CAD s\/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial fibrillation, h\/o cardiac arrest with heart block s\/p AICD\/pacemaker, trach\/PEG, and recent ICU admission with GI bleed, hematuria, and MRSA bacteremia, who presented from rehab with fevers and persistent MRSA bacteremia while on vancomycin. #. MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent bacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood cultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite appropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent seeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both negative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his pacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult focus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity ultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot but was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced at ___ was removed. A new one was not placed until he had negative blood cultures. He was continued on vancomycin and dosing was changed to 1g q48h. Further blood cultures were negative. Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular source but it was not found during this hospitalization. He should be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date of his last positive blood culture, with last day ___. #. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an indwelling foley it was suspected that this might be colonization however his cultures were positive even after changing his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his urine as well as wound culture. It was multidrug resistant pseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day course. He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough < 1. He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his urine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last day ___. #. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his MRSA bacteremia. Other cultures returned positive as above. He also had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with septic arthritis. His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line holiday. He was ruled out for C diff. #. Acute renal failure: BUN\/creatinine elevated to 70\/1.7 on admission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor forward floor from chronic systolic CHF. His creatinine slowly improved with diuresis. #. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical ventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to trach mask for any length of time. This was felt to be related to chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial pulmonary edema. Diuresis was difficult due to his large obligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix 80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid. His metolazone may need to be decreased over the next several days if he is overdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen for the few days prior to discharge. On the day of discharge, he was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the 300's. #. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during this admission. #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his home carvedilol. His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely and was not restarted due to renal failure. He was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his creatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing diuresis. #. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV. He was started on a fentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control. #. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure remained stable during this admission. He is off anticoagulation due to h\/o GI bleeding and hemothorax. He was continued on carvedilol. #. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who recommended the following: 1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid management. Turn q 2 hours. 2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry. 3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft sorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily. 4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and wrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape. 5. No tape on skin. 6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days. 7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to assist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with Mepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days. 8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal tissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to assess with edema. 9. Waffles bilateral feet. 10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily. 11. Support nutrition and hydration.

At that time, he only had single vessel disease. The patient presents with a different type of discomfort than his previous anginal pain. Cardiac enzymes x 3 were normal and there were no EKG changes. The patient did not experience any discomfort during the hospitalization. He was continued on Plavix, high dose aspirin, lisinopril and a statin. A beta blocker was held because he had an adverse reaction to it in the past. Since his discomfort was different than his prior and his last cath was only 2 months ago, it was decided to perform a stress echo on the patient. The stress echo was normal revealing excellent physical endurance and a very good functional exercise capacity without ECG of 2D echo evidence of inducible ischemia.

Denies vision changes, sensitivity to light, syncope, URI sx, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, diarrhea\/constipation, sick contacts. Has mild neck stiffness as well. He lives in ___, does a lot of yardwork. Has had exposure to ticks, mosquitoes, but none he memorably recalls recently. No recent travel hx. No rash. He was feeling entirely well prior to onset of these symptoms. Given terrible headache and fever, he presented to the ED. Hospital Course to Date: The pt was admitted for acute onset headache and fever. LP showed a cell count of 141 with lymphocytic predominance and elevated protein to 100. He was initially started on bacterial meningitis coverage, then narrowed to acyclovir based on negative CSF stain and cultures. Doxycycline was added to cover potential lyme meningitis. The pt's CSF came back positive for HSV PCR. Per ID recommendations from ___: \"Would recommend continuing on Acyclovir for now but when safe for discharge can change to Valtrex 1 gram po three times per day to complete 14 day course. In setting of only low positive HSV 2 PCR and extensive outdoor activity would also complete 14 day course of doxycycline even though lyme is less likely.\" The pt improved dramatically. His headache resolved. Throughout his hospitalization, he had no confusion or neurologic deficits. He was transitioned to oral acyclovir the day before discharge and discharged on PO acyclovir + PO doxycycline for a total 14 day course. Of note, the pt was incidentally found to have an abnormally low Hb on admission. He required 1u PRBC transfusion ___. He denies any known bleeding. GI was consulted and recommended EGD + colonoscopy, performed ___. EGD showed diffuse erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding noted in the antrum, consistent with gastritis. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential mass of malignant appearance in the distal rectum completely encircling the rectal verge. There were local ulcerations in the 12:00 position. Colorectal surgery was consulted. They recommended follow up at the colorectal cancer clinic. Follow up was arranged prior to discharge and the pt was aware of the diagnosis and need for follow up. The clinic and colorectal surgery asked for a baseline CEA which was normal. They asked for a staging MRI pelvis which did not show any spread of the presumed cancer. Pathology was sent by GI. Initial pathology showed superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma. This was pending at the time of discharge, though initial reports had shown the same diagnosis, so the pt was instructed to follow up with GI. The GI phone number was shared with the patient and he was instructed to call them directly if he did not hear from the clinic within 24 hours. The pt received a total of 2u PRBCs this hospitalization. Hb was 7.2 on the morning of discharge and the pt received 1u PRBCs (the second unit this stay) on the day of discharge after the Hb of 7.2 in order to ensure that his Hb did not drop below 7.0 at home. Close follow up was arranged prior to discharge. The pt had no active bleeding at the time of discharge. Return to ER precautions such as dizziness and increased bleeding were reviewed with the patient. The pt's BP meds were held on admission but restarted prior to discharge.","summary":"You came to the hospital with severe headache and fevers. You were found to have a viral meningitis with testing showing herpes simplex virus to be the cause. Please continue taking Valtrex and doxycycline until ___ to treat this infection. When you were in the hospital, you were found to have iron deficiency anemia. You were seen by the Gastroenterologists. You underwent an EGD and a colonoscopy. The EGD showed a little stomach irritation. Avoid ibuprofen, higher dose aspirin, and naproxen. Take pantoprazole to help with the irritation. There was no cancer found in the stomach. The colonoscopy showed a rectal cancer."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a PMH notable for ESRD s\/p LRRT in ___ (on tacro, cyclosporin, and prednisone), T1DM, CREST syndrome, CAD s\/p MI x2 and DES x3 in ___, who presented with confusion, fevers, and headache, as well as nausea\/vomiting. #ENCEPHALOPATHY: She has had several prior presentations for confusion in the past few years without any definitive etiology, previously attributed to Tacrolimus toxicity (at which time she was switched to rapamycin, but switched back to Tacro after developing proteinuria) and hypoglycemia. After these episodes, she returns to her baseline. On this admission, she was evaluated for many causes including infection; iatrogenic etiologies; PRES and vascular dementia. 1) INFECTION: Ruled out for meningitis with an LP (negative for bacterial etiologies as well as HSV, CMV, and other viruses). She received approximately 7 days of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and aclyovir while awaiting study results, and 5 days of bactrim. She also had significant pyuria but no bacteria grew on urine culture; however, 7d of cef\/vanc treated this possible diagnosis. She had no other localizing signs or symptoms of infection. 2) IATROGENIC CAUSES: Though she didn't have characteristic tremors, her tacro was replaced by cyclosporin in case this was toxicity. Several other medication changes were made, detailed under transitional issues below, to minimize those that can cause confusion. 3) POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME (PRES) and 4) VASCULAR DEMENTIA: The patient did initially get better by ___, but on subsequent days was more confused again, particularly about higher-level functioning, such as not remembering how she gives herself insulin with meals. Given some ongoing hypertension (pressures often in the 150s-170s, rarely as high as 180s-190s), and the relapsing-remitting presentation, there was concern for PRES in the setting of immunosuppression. Her initial MRI was of limited utility due to artifact so a repeat MRI was done on ___ which did not show evidence of PRES or lingering encephalitis. However, it did show microangiopathy and microvascular changes that could have progressed from prior scans -- not from most recent scan, however. Course additionally notable for grossly normal electrolytes; EEG with no seizures but intermittent right parietal slowing not correlating to findings on exam or imaging; and normal folate\/B12\/TSH. The patient was clearly improved (close to her \"real\" self, per her sister) at time of discharge, but still lacked some higher-level functioning (not remembering how she doses insulin with meals). It was not clear to us that glucose, blood pressure could explain her course. Unfortunately, we did not come to a satisfying diagnosis for the patient. Given what appears to be a stepwise decline, and her elevated blood pressures, and MRI findings, we are concerned for vascular dementia, but if this were to explain her previous episodes, we would expect her not to regain functioning in-between, and would expect worsening on imaging since ___. It could have been that N\/V lead to an ___ causing transient Tacro toxicity and leading the patient to commit errors in taking her medications, exacerbating confusion, but this is entirely impossible to prove (and she had no ___ on admission). Ultimately, we discussed with the family the need for further outpatient workup and to minimize medications that can contribute to confusion. # HYPERTENSION: Persistent on home medication, generally higher in the morning. Has been <180 except for rare exceptions, but regularly 150-170s. With proteinuruia that developed during admission, likely not attributable to cyclosporin. Unclear if elevated from neuropathic pain or nausea as patient only intermittently endorses these. Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily and ultimately held losartan due to ___. Continued metoprolol. # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY and # PROTEINURIA in the setting of # ESRD s\/p LRRT: Generally maintained UOP >2L\/day. Did develop proteinuria on ___ (noted due periorbital edema), but this downtrended. Of note, patient was switched to cyclosporine on ___ due to concern for Tacro contribution to AMS and had an ___ on ___ attributed to elevated cyclosporin levels, downtrending by discharge. Mycophenolate and prednisone continued. There was initial concern for rejection based on transplant ultrasound, but stable function and output were reassuring. # BRITTLE T1DM: Complicated by nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Insulin adjusted as per discharge medication list. # NEUROPATHY: Chronic problem for patient for which she is on many medications that can contribute to altered mental status. Held all of these, and she was able to tolerate. Discussed utility of adding back slowly and with help of a doctor to ensure she is not more confused on any of them. # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient has a reported history of APLS, but the diagnosis was not clear when Hematology was consulted in ___. Patient prefers to be on anticoagulation per that documentation. Discussed reasoning for being on warfarin with patient and her sister. The 3 concerns the patient had were for pulmonary embolism, stroke and protecting her stents. We talked about the risks of bleed (which she has already had) on warfarn; the role of aspirin in protecting her stents; absence of literature using warfarin as empiric stroke protection in patients without AF (and risk of hemorrhagic conversion if stroke occurred); and the fact that her PE in the 1990s was provoked and only required brief treatment. Though the risk of PE and potentially stroke are higher off of warfarin, her history of massive GI bleed and presence other modifiable risk factors to reduce likelihood of stroke made discontinuing warfarin a reasonable plan. We initially held warfarin in setting of possibility for procedures and her INR was reversed for LP; after discussing with patient we decided to continue to hold warfarin but touch base with outpatient providers. They agreed over email to the discontinuation. # NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Likely gastroparesis. Abdomen exam benign; LFTs and lipase normal. Per patient, had been going on for months (since pre-___). Became much less frequent while inpatient. Of note, family thinks this could be tied to confusion as primary neurologic cause. We discharged her with metoclopramide in addition to ondansetron as PRN antiemetics. # CAD: home aspirin, atorvastatin, ranolazine, metoprolol. Underwent triple angioplasty at ___ for CAD for angina in ___. Atorvastatin dose-reduced to 10mg in setting of cyclosporin, which increases myopathies; it can be increased as patient tolerates, and she was discharged on 20mg. # PVD: Home cilostazol # Hypothyroidism: Home levothyroxine # History of GI Bleed: Home esomeprazole. # CODE: FULL (presumed) # CONTACT: ___ (sister, ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ================== #FOLLOW UP LABS: Please obtain Chem-10, CBC, UA, CK and cyclosporin levels on ___ and fax them to ___, MD, at the ___ Kidney ___ (FAX: ___ #HYPERTENSION: If the patient's blood pressure is consistently >160\/90, please contact Dr. ___ at the Kidney ___ @ ___ MEDICATION CHANGES: ------------------- NEUROPATHY MEDS: Gabapentin, duloxetine and vicodin all held in the setting of altered mental status. The patient reported that her neuropathy was not bothering her significantly during admission. Please consult with transplant team (specifically transplant pharmacology) if patient has escalating neuropathy, as there may be an alternative medicine (such as pregabalin) that could cause less confusion while also not interacting with immunosuppression. #NAUSEA MEDS: Switched ondansetron for promethazine as an antihistamine may contribute more to confusion. Change approved by transplant pharmacy. #ANTIHYPERTENSIVES: -AMLODIPINE increased from 2.5mg BID to 10mg daily -LOSARTAN discontinued due to ___ -METOPROLOL continued #ANTICOAGULATION: As described above, long conversation with patient and sister (HCP ___ resulted in holding Warfarin. She was reversed with Vitamin K for her LP, so last day of therapeutic coverage wasa ___. #ATORVASTATIN: lowered dose from 40mg to 10mg per day because of increased myopathy risk in cyclosporine. She tolerated 10mg for several days and was increased to 20mg on day of discharge. Okay to increase back to 40mg if patient tolerates it without side effects. #RANITIDINE: This was held after confirming with GI Dr. ___ ___. Concerned that large dose could contribute to patient's confusion. #PRAMIPEXOLE: Held in setting ___ and not restarted due to nausea and headaches (presenting complaints) being side effect, and patient having significant restless leg syndrome during inpatient stay. Of note, she was stable and without worsened neuropathy, headache or nausea for several days on this altered regimen prior to discharge. FOLLOW UP ---------- - Patient should see Dr. ___ about possible diagnosis of vascular dementia vs. other etiologies for recurrent\/worsening confusion. - MRI showed \"T1 hyperintense focus of the right thalamus on sagittal T1 sequence without correlate of signal abnormality on other sequences. This is presumably artifactual in nature,\" but CT could be obtained to compare. - Hematology: Per ___ inpatient hematology note, patient should follow up in ___ clinic for possible APLS, though doees not appear from this documentation and concurrent labs that this patient carries this diagnosis. Conversation with patient about anticoagulation documented above. Likely does not need hematology f\/u, but this should be on the radar particularly if the patient has other questions given her history.","summary":"Please see below for information on your stay. You were very confused, and your family was worried about you Many CT scan pictures of your head ruled out stroke or big problems in your brain. A lumbar puncture (LP) was negative for any bacterial infection. Studies sent off for infections caused by viruses were also negative. 7 days of antibiotics were given while waiting for these results. 7 days of antibiotics were given to treat a possible urinary tract infection, though your urine never grew bacteria. Many of the medicines you were on could cause confusion, so we stopped the ones we thought it was safe to stop. Your kidney transplant medicine, Tacrolimus, was switched to another called Cyclosporin. An MRI of the brain ruled out certain reasons for your confusion, but did show evidence of possible tiny strokes. Your blood pressure was very high, so your antihypertensive medicine was adjusted. Your sugars were low at first when you weren't eating, and then were very high, so your insulin was adjusted. We talked about stopping your coumadin\/warfarn because it is a dangerous medicine and you do not have a strong reason to be on it. Your creatinine went up, which we think was due to too much cyclosporin. This medicine was reduced. You got much better, but weren't 100% back to your normal self. We talked about the importance of following up with your outpatient team."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ F h\/o DMI diagnosed at age ___ with no prior h\/o DKA, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, HLD, anxiety who presents with nausea, vomiting and hyperglycemia. ACTIVE ISSUES #) Hyperglycemia: Likely DKA given blood sugars elevated to the 300s and h\/o DMI, with evidence of ketonuria. Precipitant unclear; most likely due to malfunctioning pump. Other possible precipitants included infection such as viral gastroenteritis or pneumonia. Initial AG was 24. She was treated with insulin drip and her gap closed. She was transitioned to BID Lantus and Humalog sliding scale insulin. She was seen by ___ who provided recommendations for insulin titration. She was also seen by a diabetes nurse educator who provided recommendations to transition the patient back onto her pump prior to discharge. She was transiently hyperglycemic on the night prior to discharge, as expected given her transition from glargine and humalog injections back onto her pump and received a correction bolus. She is discharged home with ketone strips and will follow up in the ___ clinic 2 days after discharge on ___. #) Leukocytosis: Differential diagnosis included infection versus hemoconcentration. Infection could be viral gastroenteritis based on abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting (though these symptoms could be a manifestation of DKA rather than precipitant). CXR revealed impressive obscuration of right heart border, which may represent aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis in the setting of nausea\/vomiting. She did not have SOB or cough to suggest typical or atypical PNA. She did not have dysuria to suggest UTI. Considered influenza given reported myalgias, generalized weakness and subjective fever, though patients illness began with abrupt onset GI distress making flu less likely. Leukocytosis may be a reflection of hemoconcentration to some extent given elevated albumin and Hgb\/Hct approaching upper range of normal with significant decrease in all cell lines after receiving IVF fluids. She was started on azithro\/CTX for five-day course and then transitioned to azithro monotherapy. CHRONIC ISSUES #) Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine. #) Epilepsy: Continued home lamotrigine. #) HLD: Continued home simvastatin. #) Anxiety: Continued home alprazolam. Continued home fluoxetine. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES * Patient will follow up with ___ on ___ to adjust insulin pump","summary":"As you know, you came to the hospital with nausea and vomiting.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: This ___ yo woman was admitted with complaints to gait instability and slowness of speech as outlined in the HPI. She had an otherwise normal neuro exam, but given her history of prior stroke and vascular risk factors, she received a brain MRI and MRA of the head and neck, which showed 2 small infarcts in the right lenticulostriate area and right frontal subcortical area. These were thought to be due to a small vessel disease. Her MRA was unrevealing. Her bloodwork revealed elevated lipids, for which she was started on Zetia and omega-3 fatty acids as she indicated that she could not tolerate lipitor in the past because it made her weak. Her HgbA1C was mildly elevated to 6.7, and she was counceled that she may have, at the least, glucose intolerence. She was instructed to modify her diet, be physically active, and follow this up with her PCP. Because she became angry when told of the possibilty of diabetes, these instructions, along with her med changes, were discussed with both her son and daughter. She was also counceled to stop smoking, and to be compliant with her medications. The patient will be scheduled for an echicardiogram as an outpatient to complete her work-up.","summary":"You have had multiple strokes (a small acute right posterior frontal subcortical infarct and an acute right sided lenticulostriate territory infract).
