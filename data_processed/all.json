{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with a history of HTN, HL, and significant smoking history who was admitted to ___ with cough and hypoxia in the setting of recent viral illness, transferred initially to our ICU for worsening hypoxia requiring intubation, treated for CAP, found to have new stress induced dilated cardiomyopathy (c\/w Takatsubo's). ACTIVE ISSUES: ================ # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Most likely multifactorial, due to viral pneumonia with superimposed atypical pneumonia, as well as newly developed heart failure with fluid overload. She decompensated during hospitalization at ___ and required intubation, so after completing course of CTX\/azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia, she was broadened to vancomycin \/ cefepime \/ azithromycin + TMP\/SMZ + high dose prednisone for HCAP, PCP, and COPD exacerbation. Autoimmune\/other non-infectious etiologies seem less likely given lack of improvement on high-dose steroids. In spite of significant smoking history, ___ PFT's did not show obstructive defect. Initially lower suspicion for pulmonary edema given apical predominance of pulmonary infiltrates, though BNP slightly up at 800 on admission to ___ ___. She self-extubated on the morning of ___, and remained stable on high flow oxygen. She was narrowed to ceftriaxone \/ azithromycin to complete a course for atypical community acquired pneumonia once mycoplasma and chlamydia Abs were positive (at ___, although for mycoplasma, IgM was NEGATIVE). Given failure to wean oxygen for several days after extubation, a TTE was obtained, which revealed newly depressed LVEF = 35 %, regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution) vs. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and BNP of 9353 (see discussion below). She was diuresed and oxygen requirements improved, and ultimately she was discharged on home O2, with 2L requirement. #Atypical Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient initially presented to ___ with URI symptoms, cough, and hypoxia. Treated with azithromycinand ceftriaxone, as well as Bactrim out of c\/f PCP and ___ for presumed COPD exacerbation, initially improving, then decompensated in terms of oxygenation, requiring BiPAP, prompting intubation and transfer to ___, where she was broadened to vancomycin and cefepime, and restarted on Bactrim and pulse steroids with prednisone. HIV at ___ was negative. Also with negative flu swab at OSH (received flu shot this year). Urine strep and legionella Ag negative at OSH.. Bronchoscopy and BAL cultures here negative, including PJP. Mycoplasma IgG and Chlamydia antibodies were positive. She was narrowed to ceftriaxone \/ azithromycin to complete a course for atypical community acquired pneumonia. She self-extubated on ___, and weaned from high flow to nasal cannula. Given continued wet cough, patient was provided with a flutter valve to aid with mucous clearing, and treated with guaifenesin and benzonatate. Persistent O2 requirement this admission, with 2L requirement at rest and with activity prior to discharge, discharged with home O2 (has required discharge with home O2 in the past). #Acute Systolic Heart Failure\/ #stress cardiomyopathy: Given patient's continued O2 requirements following extubation, Echocardiogram was done and showed new EF of 35% and apical hypokinesis, consistent with either CAD (mid LAD lesion) versus Takatsubo's. Echocardiogram done at OSH on ___ with EF of >55%. BNP of 9353, no known hx of CHF. Given patient's lack of anginal symptoms and normal troponins, felt likely stress-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (Takatsubo's) in the setting of acute illness. Cardiology was consulted, recommended starting on ASA 81mg, metoprolol, and ___, as well as diuresis. Diuresed initially with Lasix, and later with ethacrynic acid out of concern for Lasix-induced otoxicity (discussed below). Patient diuresed well, and her volume status improved, and patient ultimately discharged on 20mg PO daily Lasix given low likelihood of true allergy (see discussion below). Per Cardiology, will need a repeat Echocardiogram in ___ weeks, and a follow up cardiology appointment with Dr. ___. Of note patient's home diltiazem was discontinued on discharge, given patient's new medications and stable pressures in the 100-110 range systolic. Will need to address restarting this medication as an outpatient with PCP and at cardiology follow up appointment. Per report, this medication is for esophageal spasms. #Bilateral Hearing Loss: Patient noted to have hearing loss during her ICU stay, ___ days after starting 20mg IV Lasix boluses for aforementioned heart failure. Out of concern for Lasix-induced ototoxicity, this medication was stopped and listed as an allergy, and patient was subsequently diuresed with ethacrynic acid. On exam, noted to have significant cerumen impaction, which was felt more likely the cause of the patient's hearing loss. ENT recommended disimpaction of cerumen and subsequent audiogram to further assess hearing once cerumen removed. Patient treated with carbamide peroxide drops, tap water irrigation, as well as mineral oil, without full clearance of cerumen. Will continue with ear drops and follow up with PCP. Given improvement in hearing with treatment of cerumen, discharged on PO Lasix per above. # Hyponatremia, chronic: Also with noted hyponatremia this admission, with history of hyponatremia, possible history of SIADH. Initially noted at ___ ___ and ___ to be consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, however persistent in low 130s despite initial fluid resuscitation. Subsequently volume overloaded, potentially some component of hypervolemic hyponatremia, however little improvement with diuresis, and persistent now despite patient being largely euvolemic. Possible SIADH from chronic pain (hip and back, as well as foot), defer further management to outpatient setting. CHRONIC ISSUES: ================= #Presumed COPD: Patient with extensive smoking history, now with persistent O2 requirements this admission. Has previously been discharged on O2 in the past, however not on home O2 at baseline. Noted to have normal PFTs in ___. With continued diuresis per above, able to wean oxygen to 2L, and discharged home with O2 per above. Consider repeating PFTs as an outpatient. # Hypertension: Continued home diltiazem initially. No known history of a-fib. Changed to metoprolol in the setting of heart failure, and can be further titrated to heart rate.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: ===================== In brief this is a ___ yo female with hx of breast cancer s\/p bilateral mastectomy, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, type II DM, recent left MCA stroke, AF on dabigatran, mixed systolic-diastolic CHF (EF 42% on ___, admitted from urgent visit for orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, decreased appetite and trouble swallowing, became acutely hypotensive on ___ secondary to multietiology shock that resolved with addressing of underlying etiologies described below. Patient stabilized and called out to cardiology service where she underwent diuresis with improvement in BNP and mental status. Her course was complicated by persistent a fib with RVR for which she was placed on digoxin and low dose metoprolol with good response. She underwent PEG tube placement due to poor PO intake, though she was cleared for pureed foods by the speech team. She was discharged to rehab. She may benefit from cardioversion once on anticoagulation for appropriate duration. ACUTE PROBLEMS: =============== # HFrEF (EF 23%) # Tachymyopathy vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy Patient presented with poor PO intake\/failure to thrive and received volume resuscitation. This, in conjunction with unidentified newly reduced ejection fraction, likely triggered subsequent Afib with RVR. Rate control was attempted with metoprolol. This precipitated cardiogenic shock requiring brief admission to the MICU. On TTE she was found to have newly reduced EF of 23% (compared to prior 42%) with global hypokinesis most likely from tachymyopathy due to poorly controlled atrial fibrillation prior to this admission. Missed ischemic event was considered but cardiac cath was not pursued due to frailty. Was trialed on Lasix boluses and subsequently bumex gtt prior to transfer from ICU. On transfer to the floor, patient was continued on lasix gtt and converted to PO Lasix when euvolemic. She was started on digoxin for rate control of afib (see below). Afterload reduction was managed with captopril. She was eventually tolerating low-dose metoprolol after rate control with digoxin. Discharge weight was 136 pounds. She will follow up with cardiology NP in one week and Dr. ___. # Atrial fibrillation First diagnosed in ___ after suffering from stroke. CHADSVASC of 8. She was prescribed Diltiazem prior to this admission. Upon arrival she was found to have afib with RVR in the low 100s and she was volume depleted. With volume repletion and uptitration of metoprolol for rate control, she became hypotensive. All rate control was held. She was subsequently started on digoxin for rate control, and low-dose metoprolol was subsequently added and tolerated. Due to intermittent swallowing issues\/pocketing meds in her mouth, home dabigatran had to be converted to apixaban so that she could receive it via her PEG tube. During this hospitalization she was considered for cardioversion but she had reportedly missed some doses of her anticoagulation prior to admission. Going forward, she may benefit from cardioversion. She has consistently been anticoagulated since ___ (she was on it prior to that but it was held briefly for her PEG tube placement). At discharge she was still in atrial fibrillation but with heart rates in the ___. # ___ Cr peaked at 2.4 with limited urine output. FeNA suggestive with prerenal etiology, consistent with cardiorenal as driving etiology with contribution from ATN from shock described above. Her creatinine improved to 0.8 at the time of discharge. # Coagulopathy Unclear etiology. liver function seems normal. Vitamin K challenge 5 IV x3 days with minimal improvement. # Toxic metabolic encephalopathy # Delirium Recent stroke, likely acute delirium iso critical illness. CT head negative. She became quite hypernatremic after starting tube feeds, which correlated with her cognitive decline. She improved substantially after correction of her serum sodium but still remained occasionally disoriented to place\/time. # Failure to thrive # Concern for dysphagia # Weight loss No clear etiology, as decreased PO intake and weight loss began prior to recent stroke. Patient's function and PO intake have appeared to continuously worsen since stroke. CT abd\/pelvis\/chest ___ with no e\/o malignancy or occult infection. Per discussion w\/daughter, daughter would like to maximize nutrition (including tube feeds) given this is an acute decline. The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow time and was cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids. It was decided that she could take in whatever desired PO that she would like, and that would be supplemental to tube feeding. She underwent PEG placement on ___ and was started on bolus tube feeds 3x daily. Tube feeds should not be given 2 hours prior to AM levothyroxine or two hours after levothyroxine in order to allow maximum drug absorption. # C diff Patient developed diarrhea in early ___. C diff stool PCR was positive. She completed a 10 day course of PO vancomycin: ___. She was no longer symptomatic at discharge. CHRONIC\/STABLE ISSUES: ====================== # OSA Has diagnosis of severe OSA, on BIPAP at home though compliance is unclear. She should continue BiPAP at ___ nightly. # Left MCA stroke with dysarthria and right hemiparesis on ___ NCHCT from ___ showed sequela of recent L MCA infarction. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. She has right sided hemiparesis. Continue atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily # Type II diabetes mellitus Restart home metformin and glipizide at discharge. Her blood glucose was appropriate on 10 units of Lantus daily, but this may require adjustment once she gets on a regular schedule of bolus tube feeds. # Hypothyroidism Continue home levothyroxine 75 mcg daily. TSH and FT4 were checked and were appropriate. Tube feeds should be held two hours prior to AM dose and two hours after AM dose to allow maximum absorption. # GERD Continue pantoprazole 40 mg daily # Anemia She is a ___ Witness and cannot receive blood products. # Hypertension Continue captopril, consider changing to lisinopril 2.5. She did not tolerate higher doses of lisinopril in-house and became hypotensive. ========================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ========================= [ ] Discharge weight: 136 pounds [ ] Discharge diuretic: Lasix 20 mg daily [ ] Diltiazem was discontinued and should not be restarted due to her reduced ejection fraction. [ ] Dabigatran was switched to apixaban because dabigatran cannot be given through PEG tube and she occasionally pockets medications in her mouth. [ ] Consider switching captopril to lisinopril.

ACUTE ISSUES: ============= #Chronic Diarrhea #Nausea\/Vomiting #Poor PO intake #Weight Loss #Failure to thrive #Severe protein calorie malnutrition Patient reported several months of diarrhea, which she said would float at times. She states she has also lost over 20 pounds since ___. Patient has also had chronic vomiting which has worsened over the last few weeks. She stated that it had been occurring with liquids and solids, and it would occur just seconds to minutes after starting to eat. Does smoke marijuana but not daily and vomiting not associated with use, cyclical vomiting less likely. Given her history of chronic alcohol use and mild epigastric tenderness, pancreatic dysfunction was thought to be a possibility. Her recent MRI liver and CT abdomen pelvis showed no signs of acute or chronic pancreatitis, although this does not rule out exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Her EGD on ___ had normal biopsies and no structural abnormalities, but positive for H pylori. Imaging and EGD with no abnormal masses, making GIST\/VIPoma\/Carcinoid tumor less likely. GI was consulted, recommended the following studies. Stool studies showed negative O&P, culture. Elastase, calprotectin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin were low but per GI not diagnostic of EPI given her very poor PO intake precding this. Stool K and Na suggested mixed secretory\/osmotic diarrhea, which could also be in carbohydrate malabsorption. Fecal fat was pending at time of discharge. Vitamin D was normal, although she is on supplementation for osteoporosis. Anti-TTG IgA was not elevated and total IgA was normal, so less likely Celiac. HIV antibodies were negative. TSH was normal. CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology. She had a colonoscopy on ___ which showed a few benign appearing sessile polyps which were biopsied. She had a gastric emptying study ___ which showed no evidence of gastroperisis. Her CRP was mildly elevated at 47.5, making an acute flair of IBD less likely. She also denied any bloody diarrhea or focal pain in the LLQ. She has a history of one oral lesion, which is most likely related to her dentures. From a nutrition standpoint, her prealbumin was low at 10, Zinc was low (likely falsely low in the setting of high CRP) and Copper was normal. Her weight on admission was 114, and she says her baseline a few months ago is 140. Her weight on the day of discharge was 116. Nutrition consulted. For management of her nausea, she was given Compazine for nausea control prior to meals. Reglan was added standing in addition and she was able to tolerate good PO intake by day of discharge, with discharge weight 116. Despite her history of diarrhea, patient developed constipation during admission, possibly contributing to her nausea and abd pain, increased bowel reg and had BMs by day of discharge. She still endorsed nausea and ___ abd pain at discharge. She was treated for H pylori gastritis as below. She should have outpatient breath testing for H pylori eradication and SIBO breath testing with GI for follow up. #H. pylori gastritis Patient had an EGD on ___ which demonstrated gastritis and biopsy evidence of H. pylori. This could contribute to her nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain. Based on these findings, she was initially recommended bismuth quadruple therapy. However, the patient reported an adverse effect of hearing loss secondary to prior tetracycline use. Additionally, she reports a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and sulfa drug use in the past. She was started on a two week course of triple therapy with ___ with metronidazole 500mg TID, clarithromycin 500 BID, and pantoprazole 40mg BID (D1 of antibiotics ___.

Telemetry showed mostly sinus tachycardia with one short possible asymptomatic bout of SVT. She received electrolyte repletion and no further arrhythmias were seen on telemetry. She did not exhibit any infectious symptoms. Per her friend ___, she has had a \"fast heart for years\". Pt denies prior cardiac dysfunction. Says she can feel her heart race sometimes, but denies any chest pain. Outside records show her HR has fluctuated b\/w 80-110 on clinic visits.

She described it as a ___ and denied it being the worst headache of her life. Her neuro exam at that time was non-focal. This was thought to be most consistent with a migraine. Her headache resolved with Compazine and oxycodone. She had a head CT performed earlier in her admission (per above), which did not show any obvious underlying causes of possible mass effect. Her neuro exam remained non-focal throughout her admission. She denied a history of migraines, and possible triggers for this episode could be her acute illness, new medication (metronidazole and clarithromycin although not common causes of migraines). In terms of management if this recurs, she should avoid NSAIDs due to her gastritis, and the patient states she has an allergy to Tylenol, which she reports as an episode of acute severe pain after trying Tylenol. She can try caffeine in the future and should follow up with her primary care if this continues to be an issue. #Rash On ___, patient endorsed a new itchy rash.

He had recent hospital visits for radiation therapy, so his abx treatment was initially IV vancomycin + cefepime to ensure coverage for HCAP. CT chest scan findings were consistent with infection as well. There was initially a concern for possible radiation pneumonitis given he had undergone XRT, but per radiation oncology attending's review, the likelihood of radiation pneumonitis was low given the time course and discrepancy in new pulmonary findings compared to the field of prior radiation therapy received. Blood and sputum culture results were negative and his abx therapy was eventually narrowed to po levofloxacin for an 8-day total abx course. His cough progressively decreased during his admission and his respiratory status improved. Pt also benefitted from receiveing gauifenesin, ipratroprium nebs and incentive spirometry. Although his respiratory status had improved compared to admission, on day of discharge pt still had supplemental oxygen requirement based on ambulatory O2 sat testing which showed 83-85% O2 on room air with ambulation. #CHF exacerbation In addition to PNA, pt presented with volume overload likely due to acute CHF exacerbation in the s\/o infection.

Last time you were here the ascites did not appear infected, but there were also no malignant cells seen under the microscope. We believe that your recurrent distension and ascites are related to worsening liver involvement of your cancer. We had your ascites drained and the fluid analyzed. We also did an ultrasound of your liver to make sure the veins did not have clots and that the bile system was draining properly. These tests showed significant tumor in your liver, but no blood clots in the veins or evidence of obstruction of the bile drainage. The ascites fluid did not appear to be infected. We felt it safe to discharge you. In the future you may need a long term catheter placed in your abdomen to allow repeated drainage of your ascites."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with CAD s\/p multiple PCIs most recently in ___, poorly-controlled DM1, ESRD s\/p LRRT on immunosuppression and APLS presenting with recurrent chest pain relieved by nitroglycerin. Found to have asymptomatic bacteriuria. - CORONARIES: LMCA clean. LAD with DES. Cx\/OM with DES. Diagonal 50-60% stenosis. LPL branch with mid\/distal 60% stenosis. - PUMP: normal EF - RHYTHM: sinus # Angina: patient with chest pain occurring at rest, multiple times, relieved by nitroglycerin, concerning for unstable angina (ACS). No chest pain in over 24 hours at this time. She did have evidence of troponin leak with troponin 0.10, which is above baseline for similar renal function. Her troponins downtrended and stabilized. She recently had PCI to LAD and Cx\/OM with DES, on warfarin, aspirin and Plavix. Cardiac catheterization at the time showed evidence of multi-vessel CAD, but patient preferred multiple PCIs over CABG. DDx: microvascular disease vs. restenosis of stent vs. progressive stenosis due to CAD. Given recent onset of symptoms following stent placement and results of recent catheterization, most likely diagnosis is angina from microvascular disease, likely secondary to T1DM. Catheterization was initially deferred given unlikely active ACS based on recent cath images. An attempt was made to start her on isosorbide dinitrate for angina but patient did not tolerate secondary to hypotension and confusion (see below). Her anginal symptoms were treated with Ranolazine instead. She was continued on aspirin and Plavix, warfarin (one dose held given initial possible cath), statin, and metoprolol. Patient having some trouble not vomiting up pills at home, but was counseled on importance of focusing on ASA\/Plavix and anti-rejection meds. #UTI, Bacteriuria: Noted to have bactiuria in urinalysis on ___ but asymptomatic. However, because patient has renal transplant, must be treated even for asymptomatic bacteriuria. She also had recent UTI but likely did not receive full tx course given vomiting pills at home. Started on ceftriaxone instead of cipro given concern for long qt on EKG on ___ (QTc 471). Recently treated for UTI with cipro, but couldn't complete treatment course because of nausea\/vomiting likely secondary to gastroparesis. She received 1 dose fosfomycin prior to discharge. Urine culture is pending. # Hypertension: SBP in 180s noted but was not symptomatic. Plan is to medically manage blood pressure in a way that does not cause hypotensive symptoms. Goal for renal transplant is BP < 140\/80 unless there is significant proteinuria, in which case goal is 130\/80. Urinalysis on ___ shows some proteinuria, so ___ consider protein:Cr ratio in outpatient setting. She was continued on amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily, losartan 50mg PO daily, and home metoprolol (see below). # ESRD s\/p LRRT complicated by CKD, likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy: baseline Cr is approximately 1.3-1.5, no signs of current problem with her graft.

FSG initially 133 but continued to decrease to 58. Lay down and received 1L IVF and started to feel better but then had recurrence 30 minutes later and was found to have low BS and stable BP ~105. Subsequently had BP to high ___. Suspected reaction to long-acting nitrate and insulin. Non-contrast head CT on ___ normal. Isosorbide dinitrate was discontinued and decreased Metop back to home dose (had attempted to increase to 25 BID). She was given 2.5L IV fluids. Decreased insulin to ___ recs from previous admissions; her insulin should be titrated as an outpatient. # DM1: Hgb A1C 9.3% (___). patient was managed on glargine and Humalog sliding scale. Her home sliding scale is (BG-130)\/17. Initially started on Glargine 36U QAM and 16U QPM, which was decreased to 26qAM & 10qHS after hypoglycemic episode. She was continued on promethazine for nausea as well as duloxetine, gabapentin and lidocaine patches for diabetic neuropathy.

In reviewing your imaging from your images from your angiography last month, it is unlikely that you are having coronary disease that would require re-catheterization. We started you on a long-acting nitrate (isosorbide dinitrate) to help with your symptoms, however this caused an unsafe drop in your blood pressure. Although this blood pressure drop was likely exacerbated by your recent dehydration from vomiting, you should let future providers know about this episode if you are prescribed it again. We also recommend that you monitor your blood pressure at home. Because you were unable to tolerate the isosorbide, we started you on a different medication, ranolazine, to help with your chest pain.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with ALS s\/p trach and PEG with recent admission for technical trach issues complicated by VAP and type II NSTEMI who presented to ___ with decreased mental status, found to have episodes of mucous plugging. # Altered mental status: During last admission, had similar brief episodes of unresponsiveness that resolved without intervention. Now presents with multiple episodes of unresponsiveness, and right then leftward eye deviation. Associated hypotension improved with lorazepam, and documentation also indicates that she became more responsive, with eyes open, following simple commands, prior to becoming unresponsive again. Per Neurology consult, these episodes are concerning for complex partial seizures, vs non-convulsive status epilepticus. Ultimately, etiology was unclear, though she has two known infections being treated with cefepime, including UTI and PNA. CT head unremarkable. EEG was performed which showed no epileptiform activity. She was switched to ceftazidime for antibiotic coverage out of concern for altered mental status\/seizures from cefepime. However, given the lack of correlate on EEG and the alternate explanation (ie respiratory distress due to mucous plugging), it is likely that her episodes both prior to and during admission were NOT seizures. She was continued on levetiracetam 750mg PO BID. # ECG changes and troponin elevation: Patient with history of recent NSTEMI, managed medically. On this admission, she had fluctuating EKG changes including intermittent PR depressions, and ___ ST segment changes, which appear most consistent with J-point elevation. Cardiology was consulted, who recommended TTE and trending of cardiac markers. She was found to have preserved EF with small pericardial effusion and EKGs c\/w pericarditis. No further treatment was recommended as the diffuse ECG changes were transient and not associated with a particular coronary distribution. Her troponins trended downward and she had no complaints of chest pain. She was continued on ASA, high-dose atorvastatin and metoprolol. # Ventilator-associated pneumonia: Diagnosed during last admission with leukocytosis, fever, RLL infiltrate, treated with cefepime for planned 15 day course, to end ___. CXR at ___ ___ shows mild persistent RLL infiltrate. She is having minimal tracheal secretions now, mild leukocytosis, and no reported fevers or hypoxemia on 30% FIO2. ___ not need to complete full 15 day treatment # Acute hypoxic respiratory distress: Her hospital course was notable for acute hypoxemic event due to mucous plugging. On ___, the patient became acutely hypoxic down into the 40's following a change in position. She was taken off the ventilator and bad masked given coinciding decreases in tidal volume. Emergent bronchoscopy was performed which revealed severe mucus plugging worse in the RLL. This plugging was relieved and patient's oxygen saturations came back up to high 90's. During this episode was observed to have extensor posturing and roving eye movements, however neurology evaluated clinical findings along with EEG and determined that they were not seizures. During the event patient was hypertensive with SBP up to 240's, fentanyl and versed bolus for sedation was given, as well as 10 mg IV labetalol. Pressures continued to be elevated throughout the afternoon and metoprolol was doubled from 6.25 Q6 to 12.5 Q6. To assist with the clearance of her secretions, she was placed on the Mechanical Insufflator Exsufflator machine, which significantly assisted improved her cough. She should use this every eight hours and also as needed. # Chronic respiratory failure: Mechanically ventilated, does not require sedation. She was continued on prior vent settings: CMV, TV 350, RR 20, FIO2 30% but with an increase in PEEP from 5 to 8. # Diabetes mellitus: continued home lantus and insulin sliding scale. # HTN: was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6hrs.

They felt that you were not having a new heart issue and did not recommend any new treatment. During your hospital stay, you had a brief episode of getting some mucous and sputum caught in your airway that caused you to lose consciousness. We were able to suck the mucous out with a bronchoscopy. From now, we recommend that you something called the MIE or Cough Assist to help you bring up secretions so as to prevent this from happening again.

The patient has a history of presumed neurosarcoid making an intracranial process more likely. Seizure less likely given no tonic-clonic movements and no post-ictal confusion. Neurology was consulted in the ED. Head CT negative for acute process. Head and neck MRI\/MRA was checked on ___ and showed progressive multifocal T2 hyperintensity in bihemispheric and central pontine white matter; could represent small vessel ischemic disease and\/or neurosarcoidosis. There was no pathologic enhancement to suggest active inflammation due to neurosarcoidosis. The MRA of head and neck was unremarkable. An EEG was checked but results were pending at the time of discharge. The patient ruled out for cardiac ischemia\/infarction with a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes. He was monitored on telemetry for 24 hours without event. Overall, it's unclear what caused the pre-syncope and altered mental status. The patient's cognitive function rapidly returned to normal even prior to admission and remained stable throughout hospitalization.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with hx dementia, prostate CA, and bladder CA who presents with recent hx hematuria, recent ___ edema, and shortness of breath. He was found to have RBBB and ST changes, edema on CXR, and evidence of right heart strain on ECHO. He was thought to have (1) worsening heart failure due to NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia vs. acute PE and (2) hematuria of undetermined cause. . # ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient presented with ___ edema and pulm edema on CXR and on exam (and recent subacute edema), consistent with heart failure. Differential for the cause of heart failures includes acute MI and acute PE. No known liver disease, but does have chronic renal insufficiency at baseline. Initially we diuresed the patient with IV Lasix, which improved his exam but worsened his renal function to a creatinine of 2.2. His blood pressures overall were not suggestive of cardiogenic shock, but he did have occassional systolic BPs below 90. The patient might have a component of preload dependence as his pressures improved with IVF and PRBC ___, and his heart failure did not appear dramatically worse. However, on ___, he was noted to have severe scrotal and moderate pre-sacral edema. Lasix was restarted without worsening renal function (creatinine of 1.7 on discharge, which appears to be his baseline). He is being discharged on 20mg PO Lasix daily and will have electrolyte and creatinine lab follow up and monitoring at the rehab facility. . # POSSIBLE PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Patient presented with shortness of breath, RBBB, tachypnea to ___ ___nd troponin leak. While these symptoms might be c\/w other etiologies such as heart failure and myocardial ischemia\/infarction, they were also very concerning for PE. In terms of PE risk, patient has factor V Leiden but no hx clot. PE strongly considered in pt with right heart strain, elevated troponins, signs of right heart failure more than left heart failure. Has renal failure so unlikely to tolerate CTA. V\/Q scan unlikely to be useful given the underlying pulmonary edema. LENIs were negative. The medical team had a long conversation with the family about goals of care and about the possible PE in particular. The family understood that their father might have a PE and that the PE could kill him if untreated. However, anticoagulating the patient with heparin (and later with warfarin) would have worsened his hematuria. Given his age, fall risk, and the goals of care, we recommended not treating the patient. The family understood the situation and the risks and did not want to pursue CTA or empiric anticoagulation. The patient did receive heparin subQ. . # NSTEMI \/ DEMAND ISCHEMIA: Patient presented with troponin leak (peaked at 1.55) and ST changes difficult to interpret in the setting of RBBB, which was found to be pre-existing at least since ___. Catheterization not c\/w patient's goals of care. Heparin gtt also not in line with goals of care and would risk worsening hematuria. We treated the patient with aspirin 325mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg daily, and metoprolol 12.5mg QID (he was eventually transitioned to metoprolol XL 25mg, a lower total dose due to heart rates in the ___ when getting 50mg total daily). On ___, we tranfused 2 units blood for dropping HCT (to 25.5) and active GU bleeding in the setting of NSTEMI\/demand ischemia. The patient denied chest pain, and his troponin trended down. . # HEMATURIA: ___ be due to prostate CA or treatment or bladder CA or treatment. Renal U\/S did reveal a lesion in the bladder (clot vs. mass). Urology was consulted, and they recommended putting in a large-bore Foley to tamponade possible prostatic bleeding and to start finasteride 5mg daily. Finasteride was started. A ___ catheter was placed, but was removed ___ when he appeared to be obstructed. He continued to pass blood and clots in his urine until ___ when the urine was clear. He did have to be straight cathed on ___ for obstruction, and we continued to monitor him with bladder scans. As above, he was transfused on ___. We spoke with radiation oncology about the possibility of palliative radiation to stop bleeding. They would need to do preferably a cystoscopy (family did not want to pursue this due to risk of anesthesia in their father) or a CT w\/ contrast (which we and the family did not want to pursue given the kidney disease). CT without contrast might localize source of bleeding enough to plan pelvic XRT. Son wanted to consider pursuing this if bleeding worsened and after meeting with urology for outpatient follow up. After transfusion on ___, HCT remained stable around ~33. . # ___ (on CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE III): Chronic kidney disease likely from DMII, unknown baseline, but appears to be in range of 1.6-1.8 base on records from ___. Patient presented with creatinine of 1.6, which increased to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis. Acute injury likely from prerenal (acute heart failure vs. over-diuresis) vs. obstruction (CA\/mass vs. clot). Obstruction was thought to be less likely given no obvious hydro on renal u\/s. Most likely prerenal is setting of over-diuresis. Creatinine stabilized in range of ~1.7-1.8. . # DMII: On oral hypoglycemics at home. Patient was put on insulin sliding scale while here. . # GOALS OF CARE: Patient was DNR\/DNI at baseline. On ___, the medicine team, along with palliative care, met with the son\/POA\/HCP ___ and the pt's daughter ___ to discuss goals of care. We agreed not to further pursue diagnosis or treatment of PE, given the patient's c\/i to IV contrast and given that we would not want to treat him right now because of his stable respiratory status, his GU bleeding, and his high fall risk. ___ and ___ are sure that they would like their father to go back to ___, the ___, and not to go to a nursing home\/SNF, or if he has to go, to go only temporarily. We discussed the option of \"do not hospitalize,\" but the family did not seem ready to make that decision. We did, however, discuss hospice, and the son spoke to case management to see if the patient meets criteria. I spoke with the son again ___ about goals of care. In addition to reviewing what we talked about at the family meeting on the day prior, we also talked about the option of \"allowing natural death\" and not transfusing blood if he were to have increased bleeding from his GU tract. Son expressed that to him and his sister, this would feel too much like \"pulling the plug.\" They are not ready to have their father be \"do not hospitalize\" or \"allow natural death,\" but they are aware that these options exist for the future. Case management spoke to the family about hospice, and they would like to continue exploring this as an option for the future. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient's family would like to get their father back to ___ (assisted living) as soon as possible, but understands he will have to go to a SNF first. - Patient's family may consider do not hospitalize (___) and\/or hospice in the future. - Urology follow-up is scheduled for early ___.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath. You had fluid in your lungs, which may have contributed to the shortness of breath. This fluid in your lungs may have been due to a heart attack, heart failure, a blood clot in your lungs, or a combination of these issues. It is very likely that you had a blood clot in your lungs, but we did not do the CT test to confirm this, given that it would likely further harm your kidneys. We also did not treat you for this blood clot, given that the treatment would increase your risk of having blood in your urine and increase the risk of you dying from a bleed in your gastrointestinal tract or head, especially if you were to fall. Your family agreed with this plan. We gave you Lasix (a diuretic) to decrease the fluid around your lungs. After we did this, your breathing improved. For your heart, we gave you aspirin (an increased dose compared to what you used to take), metoprolol (a beta-blocker, which decreases the work that your heart has does when pumping blood), and atorvastatin (which decreases cholesterol plaque formation in your arteries). You also had blood in your urine, which may have been coming from your prostate or your bladder. We transfused you with red blood cells in order to increase your red blood cell level. The bleeding stabilized."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of with HTN, DMII, HLD, morbid obesity who presented with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis. 1. NECROTIZING PANCREATITIS: Etiology of the patient's pancreatitis was not clear. CT imaging revealed a partially-necrosed pancreas with a fluid collection. There was no history of significant EtOH use, triglycerides were WNL, he had not had a recent ERCP or steroid use, and there was no evidence of gallstones on imaging. His ___ score was calculated to be >7. He received aggressive fluid resuscitation and was started on IV meropenem. Given his very significant resuscitation requirements, the patient was intubated to maintain oxygenation and ventilation in the setting of worsening anasarca and third-spacing of fluid. Surgery did not feel that his presentation warranted operative management. The patient initially began to show interval improvement after the first 48 hours as measured by lab abnormalities and fluid resuscitaton requirements, but then again decompensated with fevers > 103, a precipitous rise in WBC, a diffuse rash, and hypotension requiring more aggressive fluid resuscitation and eventual initiation of vasopressors. Repeat imaging showed no evidence of progression of necrotic pancreas or other any intra-abdominal process. The patient was empirically switched to aztreonam\/flagyl given concern for a drug-induced reaction (see below). The patient was followed with serial CT scans of his pancreas, which ultimately showed extensive pancreatic necrosis. He was maintained on TPN until he was able to tolerate enteric feeding. His clinical course was complicated by development of an ileus. His ileus was followed with serial KUB's and eventually improved. Due to significant difficulty placing a post-pyloric feeding tube, he had an NG tube placed and was started on tube feeds, which he tolerated. He had a post-pyloric feeding tube placed on ___ and tube feeds were continued. At the time of discharge, he was tolerating tube feeds well and did not require TPN. 2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: His respiratory failure was secondary to LLL collapse and pulmonary edema and increased abdominal distension from ileus and anascarca. Requiring PEEP initially as high as 18 likely secondary to increased intrabdominal pressure. When blood pressue was stable and he was able to be diuresed, he began to require less positive pressure. Dead space measurement did not reveal a significant amount of dead space present, and he was able to increasingly tolerate pressure support. Ultimately, he underwent trach placement. He was transitioned to trach mask ventilation and had a Passy-Muir Valve placed. Of note, on the afternoon after having the sutures removed from his tracheostomy site, the patient's trach tube was noted to be out of proper position. Anesthesia and CT surgery urgently evaluated the patient. He was transiently intubated, and his trach was replaced at the bedside. The patient did not have any further problems with his tracheostomy. As he approached discharge, the patient remained grossly fluid overloaded. Diuresis with IV lasix should be continued with a goal of ___ L negative a day. At the time of discharge he is slighly positive for length of stay. He will require further weaning from the trach mask. 3. BACTEREMIA\/ FEVERS: As above, he was initially started on meropenem on admission for severe pancreatitis. The meropenum was transitioned to aztreonam after he developed skin changes concerning for an allergic reaction. He continued to spike daily fevers, which were felt to possibly be related to his pancreatitis but also possibly related to an underlying infection. Eventually, he grew coag neg staph sensitive to linezolid in consecutive blood cultures from ___ and then coag neg staph that was resistant to linezolid in a blood culture on ___. Additionally, he grew pan-sensitive enterococcus faecalis in consecutive blood cultures from ___. His central venous lines were the suspected source. However, his diffuse skin breakdown in the setting of his allergic reaction was also thought to be a possible source of his staph. He underwent multiple CVL changes, given these positive cultures. TEE negative for vegetations or abscesses. Also, he grew acinetobacter from a right IJ blood cx on ___ and from multiple sputum cultures. Given his various positive cultures, he was followed by the infectious disease service, who recommended various adjustments to his antibiotic regimen. He was unable to be started on vancomycin because of a questionable history allergy reported from another facility. Allergy was consulted and felt that he is unlikely to be allergic to vancomycin; however, to be safe he should undergo a desensitization if vancomycin was necessary. He was placed on aztreonam, amikacin, and linezolid. However, aztreonam was ultimately stopped as it appeared that the acinetobacter was not susceptible. He was tried on tigecycline but developed a questionable allergic reaction. At the time of discharge, the infectious disease team recommended a total 14 day course of amikacin to end on ___. 3. SKIN RASH: As above, the patient was initially started on meropenem on admission. However, he thereafter developed a clinical decompensation, including a diffuse rash. This rash consisted of significant erythema and desquamation and ultimately covered a significant portion of the patient's upper and lower extremities as well as his trunk. When he developed this rash, he was empirically switched to aztreonam\/flagyl given concern for a drug-induced reaction (i.e. DRESS syndrome). Dermatology was consulted and agreed that the rash likely represented a drug reaction but felt that the likely inciting agent was unasyn approximately two weeks prior to rash development. Biopsies were performed and were also consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. Later in his hospital course, the patient was started on tigecycline, after which he was noted to develop a new papular rash, concerning for an allergy. The tigecycline was promptly discontinued. Allergy and Immunology was consulted to comment on patient's multiple skin reactions to various antibiotics, and it was thought the culprit was tigecycline since it correlated to his time course. However, if tigecycline would be needed in the future, the patient could undergo desensitization. Pt's skin rash improved throughout hospital course and he was seen multiple times by the wound care team who left excellent recommendations for care, which was transcribed into his discharge paperwork for continuation at rehab. 4. ABDOMINAL DISTENTION\/ ILEUS : The ___ hospital course was complicated by a prolonged ileus. There was some initial concern for c.diff, and he was kept on flagyl for an extended period of time, given the impossibility of collecting stool samples. However, stool samples were eventually negative for C. diff. His ileus was followed by serial KUB's. After several unsuccessful attempts at placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube, he was started on gastric tube feedings. He subsequently developed marked abdominal distention and tube feeds were held. His ileus improved after weaning narcotics and a few doses of methylnaltrexone. After the patient's ileus improved, he was restarted on tube feeds and tolerated them well. 5. AGITATION\/ DELERIUM: Given his intubation, the patient was initially on large amounts of IV sedation. After tracheostomy placement, the patient's sedation was weaned. In the setting of weaning his sedation, he began to experience some agitation and delirium, for which he was started on standing methadone and haldol. As these medications were tapered, he was started on standing seroquel. At time of discharge, pt was A&Ox3, at his baseline and had good insight into his condition. 6. DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK: His pancreatitis was complicated by hypotension, ultimately requiring pressors. The etiology was likely multifactoiral, including his pancreatitis, his bacteremia, and his sedation while he was intubated. As his clinical status improved and his sedation was weaned, his hypotension improved and his pressors were weaned and stopped. 7. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which initially improved with IV hydration. His hospital course was complicated by some additional elevations in his creatining, generally in the setting of CT scans. At the time of discharge, his creatinine was stable and within normal limits. 8. ANEMIA Patient's hematocrit slowely trended down during his hospitalization. NG tube contents and stool were both guaiac negative, and felt to be secondary to repeated phelbotomy. His hematocrit was trended and he was transfused PRN to maintain a HCT above 21. His blood counts had been stable for several days prior to discharge. 9. TYPE II DIABETES, c\/b neuropathy: The patient was continued on sliding scale insulin and was given insulin in his TPN. Following transfer from TPN to tube feeds he required lantus and an insulin sliding scale with meals. Due to high blood sugars, lantus 10u daily was added to his regimen, and he will continue on hospital humalog sliding scale, which may need to be adjusted as appropriate.","summary":"You were admitted for severe pancreatitis, complicated by respiratory failure, shock, and multiple blood stream infections.

This was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP. He was followed by NS, who determined that no surgical intervention was needed at this time and recommended that Keppra be started for seizure prophylaxis. They had initially recommended restarting ASA, but given the extent of his bleeds and discussion with his family, it was decided to hold anticoagulation until further evaluation with NSG in 1 month. The patient continued to have L sided weakness and L hemineglect on transfer to the floor, so Neurology was consulted.

By CT neck, findings consistent with parotitis vs facial cellulitis. Possible infectious causes of acute parotitis include viral (parainfluenza, ___, influenza A, EBV, adenovirus, HIV, CMV) and bacterial (classically staph sp, but may be caused by anaerobes, and is often polymicrobial). Mumps is of course in the ddx for acute parotitis, but is now rare in the ___, and is often associated with bilateral inflammation. Risk factors for parotitis include dehydration, for which patient may have been at increased risk in setting of recent initiation of HCTZ. DM2 is also a risk factor. Parotitis is classically associated with high fevers as in this patient. His altered mental status seems to correlate with his high fevers, in the setting of chronic small vessel ischemic changes seen on ___; at this time, AMS does not appear to be feature of underlying infectious process, but rather a sequelae of his fevers. Meets ___ SIRS criteria by fever and tachycardia. He was seen by ENT with no evidence of drainable fluid collection. He developed rash to unknown antibiotic, as he received multiple antibiotics in the ED. He was initially placed on Levofloxacin and Flagyl once admitted, but developed additional rash, so these were stopped. Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended starting IV tigecycline. He was also tested for Lyme (negative), RPR (negative), MRSA swab (NEGATIVE), Group A Strep (NEGATIVE) and Monospot (NEGATIVE). On IV tigecycline, his fever, neck swelling and neck erythema all improved. He is being discharged to complete a course of PO antibiotics with azithromycin and doxycycline per ID recommendations. All blood cultures were NEGATIVE. He will need close follow-up with PCP to assess for complete resolution of his neck swelling, and if still present, will need serial cross-sectional imaging. # Rash: Unknown timing of onset. No mention of rash per ED notes, which raises possibility that this respresents reaction to vancomycin or clindamycin given in ED. ___ also represent viral exanthem, which could be related to viral parotitis. - Trend skin exam - improved with time, nearly resolved at time of discharge. - As above, will avoid penicillin, beta-lactams, vancomycin and clindamycin for now - Recommend referral to Allergy Clinic as outpatient - did have elevated Eos, but initially normal LFT's, making DRESS less likely, however allergic reaction remains highly likely # Transaminitis: Initial LFT's normal, so DRESS less likely. Transamnitis started after initiation of IV tigecycline, and transaminitis is associated with tigecycline (4-5%), so likely medication side effect. # IDDM2: Last A1C 6.2 on ___ (Atrius). Does not check home FSBG, not on SS. - FSBG qACHS - Will reduce from glargine 60units at home to 50units while limited PO, although may require uptitration in setting of known infection - Humalog SS while inpatient - Held Metformin while inpatient, can resume on discharge. # Hypertension: - Held home hctz and enalapril in setting of high fevers and sepsis - Resume antihypertensives on discharge # Hx of SVT: Stable on verapamil and metoprolol. - Continue home verapamil SR 360 mg daily - Continue home metoprolol tartrate 25 mg BID # ADHD: home methylphenidate held during admission.

Pt tolerated the procedure well, was extubated and transferred to the PACU. Later that evening, he was transferred to the inpatient ward for further management. . On POD 1, Mr. ___ was recovering well. His pain was initially treated with a dilaudid PCA, but then transitioned to an oral narcotic and non-narcotic regimen. He remained flat to promote healing of his dural tear. He was tolerating a regular diet without issue. A foley catheter was left in place while he was in the supine position. . Medicine Summary: ___ with known chronic polymicrobial R knee prosthetic infection s\/p L1-L5 laminectomy, foraminotomy and primary repair of CSF leak due to a dural tear and corrected with a suture on ___ for lumbar stenosis who developed fever on post-operative day 2 and acute kidney injury. . #urinary retention - Patient had a Foley placed in the OR whic was removed on. However, he failed void trial on ___ early AM and bladder scan demonstrated urinary retention. His Foley was replaced and he will be discharged to rehab with the foley in place. The DDx includes spinal compression injury, though neuro exam is stable and the patient's lower extremity is strong making this very unlikely. Could also be bladder irritation due to having a Foley in place for 5 days after surgery. Unlikely that he has UTI given absence of other infectious symptoms, but we sent UA to confirm. Another contributing factor could be pain medication because pt is on Tramadol (Tylenol was held to prevent fever masking). ID Consult allowed switching to Tylenol and stopping the Tramadol prior to discharge. . #Fevers: Patient spiked fevers to 103.1 on POD2 but has been afebrile since then. At present he does not have any active signs of infection. CXR, UA did not demonstrate signs of infection. His right knee did not demonstrate signs of infection, and Ortho was consulted and agreed with this assessment. His incision also did not appear to be a source of infection. ID was consulted and we followed their recommendations including continuing home suppressive Abx against his chronic polymicrobial joint infection and holding Tylenol to avoid masking fevers. The patient did receive several doses of IV daptomycin for empiric coverage, the last one was on ___. He did not develop fevers since the IV daptomycin was discontinued.

Patient endorsed increasing dyspnea on exertion, nausea, and diaphoresis. Extensive coronary artery calcification, mainly involving the LAD, found incidentally on CT trachea on ___. While patient had atypical chest pain symptoms and negative troponin x3, he is high-risk (CAD, current smoker, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and reported that prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, and dyspnea on exertion were similar to prior presentation for MI. Therefore, decision made to proceed with cardiac catheterization. Catheterization done through right radial approach. There were serial moderate stenoses in the LCX; pressure wire evaluation negative. Single vessel CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis and diffuse slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. Given that patient's symptoms not typical for ischemia and negative pressure wire evaluation of the LCX, aggressive medical therapy was indicated rather than PCI, especially given slow flow consistent with microvascular disease that would not be addressed with PCI of epicardial vessels. Patient was therefore continued on high-dose ASA, high-dose statin, ACEI, beta-blocker, and addition of long-acting anti-ischemic medication.

It is unclear if unprovoked or provoked. During his recent hospitalization for GI bleed (below) he went without heparin SQ or DVT prophylaxis, but he was ambulating multiple times daily. In the ED was started on heparin drip. Given his recent GI bleed with unclear source, the decision was made to place an IVC filter as anticoagulation would put him at risk of continued bleed. IVC filter was placed on ___, and patient was set up with follow up with Dr. ___ will coordinate the removal of the filter in 3 months. Because he was over ___ and this was his first clot and he has no FH of clots, a hypercoaguable workup was not done in the hospital. Our concern, however, is that he may have an irreversible etiology for his DVT, such as a malignancy, especially in the setting of this GI bleed.

GI was consulted and followed the patient throughout the hospitalization. It was believed the abdominal pain came about secondary to constipation and abdominal distention. The patient was given an aggressive bowel regimen, which helped the symptoms which we believe were secondary to a previous botox injection for pelvic floor disfunction. The patient also received her second loading dose of Humira while in the hospital and was started on a course of steroids (initially IV to PO prednisone). Her abdominal pain and distension continued to improve and was at baseline at discharge. Throughout the hospitalization, the patient also had continued hypoxia, which was something she had experienced at a recent hospitalization at ___, but without any clear reason. The patient required ___ of oxygen for the first half of her stay to remain in the low ___ on her O2 stat and would desat into the high ___ and low ___ during ambulation. Outside records could not be gathered regarding any hypoxia. It was believe this was caused by a raised right hemidiaphragm causing low lung volumes, atlectosis from laying in bed, and blunting secondary to abdominal pain. The patient was also found to have a pneumonia (CAP) which was treated for 5 days with levaquin. Ultimately, once the patient began ambulating and her abdominal pain improved she was able to come of all O2 without difficulty and did not require home oxygen. The patient was also found to have leukocytosis on admission which reached a nadir of 10 during the middle of the hospitalization when the patient felt well, however began to rise without a clear cause. The WBC went up to 23.9 and stabilized around this value, and although the patient had been started on steroids, was a suspicious rise in the context of her clinical picture. A blood smear was obtained which showed inflammation, B12 deficiency, and some questionable MDS type cells. The patients B12 was found to be low at 224, but an MMA was not obtained as it an outpatient lab. To evaluate for other potential causes of leukocytosis, a CT abdomin\/pelvis was done to evaluate for potential abscess\/occult infection, and revealed a wedge-shaped infarct in a peripheral region of her liver. To further classify this and to look for any local process which could have contributed, a MRI liver was done which did not demonstrate the lesion and heme\/onc did not recommend anticoagulation. The patient was discharged home in stable condition. ======================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ======================= []Check CBC in 1 week to evaluate improving leukocytosis.

Intubation appeared to have precipitated hypotension, possibly ___ setting of pHTN (suggested on CTA). Cardiogenic shock was also on the differential given question of ischemic changes on EKG. Trops however were stable at ~0.04 and CK-MB remained flat. Neurogenic shock unlikely despite initial question of seizures given no seizure activity on EEG and no acute process on CT head. Patient was fluid resuscitated and treated with antibiotics allowing him to clinically improve and be weaned from pressors. # Respiratory Failure\/PNA: Pt presented with hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory failure. No evidence of PE on CTA; ACS ruled out. Lung process thought likely septic pneumonia complicated by COPD, although no evidence of COPD exacerbation on vent (see below). CT chest revealed near-complete collapse of entire right lung secondary to mucus plugging of the R mainstem bronchus, as well as enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pHTN, pointing to other contributors to respiratory failure. On follow-up bronchoscopy, copius purulent secretions were suctioned from the R lung; Multi lobar collapse possibly secondary to severe PNA vs. malignancy (there is a note of RUL lung mass ___ record). Pt was started on vancomycin\/zosyn\/azithromycin. Sputum cultures X2 grew klebsiella sensitive to zosyn and MRSA screen was negative therefor pt was narrowed to zosyn monotherapy. Pt was maintained on the vent and treated with nebulizers, and initially failed to improve: he was difficult to sedate, becoming alternatively apneic and unresponsive and agitated on fent\/versed. On ___ he self-extubated but immediately became hypopneic and sedated and required ventilatory support with a bag-valve mask until he could be reintubated. Gradually his respiratory status improved, and by ___ he was weaned to pressure support. Discussions had been underway regarding trach, which patient had undergone ___ the past. The decision was made that since he was on minimal vent settings, he would be given a trial of extubation, but given his volatile respiratory status the team would be ready to reintubate quickly if extubation was unsuccessful, with a plan for trach\/peg the following day. Pt was extubated successfully on ___, with no respiratory decompensation. By ___ he was alert and oriented, breathing comfortably, and was transferred to the floor. Thereafter, he maintained O2 saturations via nasal cannula, while finishing course of IV ABX for PNA (Klebsiella sensitive to Zosyn). Pt finished 10 day course of Zosyn on ___. CXR on ___ showed no interval improvement since ___, w\/ unchanged RLL opacification. ___ speaking w\/ pulm consult service, it was thought that pt would likely need time to recover fxn of that lobe. Accordingly, he was given outpatient pulmonary f\/u appt to have such issue re-addressed, as well as pHTN evaluated, and lung nodule re-imaged. # AMS\/Delerium: On admission, pt presented ___ acute confusional state, thought likely to be ___ toxic metabolic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure on EEG. CT head and MRA head both without acute processes. Pt was intermittently agitated and nearly-obtunded on sedation for ventilation, and was started on seroquel QHS. He was successfully extubated on ___, and became alert and oriented within 24 hours. He remained AOx3 thereafter without incident. # Hyperkalemia: Pt presented with a K+ of 7.7, not hemolyzed. He had presented on multiple prior occasions with hyperkalemia of unclear etiology. Differential included RTA vs. ___. No e\/o rhabdo, CK normal. No peaked Ts on EKG. Pt given kayexelate, Insulin+D5W, and his K resolved and remained stable thereafter. # ST Depressions: On admission, pt had ST depressions on EKG ___ V1-V3 concerning for ischemia; no prior EKG available for comparison. However his trop and ___ remained flat. TTE showed EF >50%, severe pulmonary hypertension but no evidence of focal wall motion abnormality or systolic dysfunction. # COPD: Status of pt's COPD not clear. No evidence of exacerbation at present. Low auto-PEEP and nearly normal peak pressures on vent. Investigation into OSH records revealed pt does not have a pulmonologist and appears not to have undergone pulmonary function testing; COPD was a presumed diagnosis given difficulty weaning from vent ___ the past. Pt was continued on tiotropium\/albuterol nebs; however steroids for COPD exacerbation were not initiated. Prior to discharge, pt was restarted on outpatient regimen of Advair and Tiotropium. Since Ipratropium seemed to be a redundant medication, it was discontinued on discharge. Pt was given outpatient pulmonary f\/u appt to have PFTs done, regimen evaluated, pHTN evaluated, and lung nodule re-imaged. #Pulmonary HTN: Given findings on TTE and CTA, severe pHTN was thought to represent the patient's primary chronic respiratory issue rather than COPD. Etiology of pHTN likely chronic OSA given pt's habitus. Thus, it was felt that pt could benefit from and R heart catheterization ___ future. Accordingly, he was provided with a pulmonary f\/u appt where such test can be scheduled. #Guiac +, Maroon Streaked Stool ___ the ICU, pt was noted to have guiac positive stool, not on anticoagulation, but Hct remained stable throughout. On admission to the medicine floor, nurses noted that pt had maroon colored blood swirled into soft brown stool. Pt had hx of rectosigmoid ca s\/p XRT\/Chemo so could possible represent anastamotic issues, radiation proctitis, recurrent malignancy or more likely gastritis, or gastric ulcer from critical illness and intubation. Pt was without elevated coags or abnormalities ___ platelets. His Hct was trended and remained stable. He was continued on a PPI and did not require blood transfusions. However, he will need outpatient gastroenterology follow up to have colonoscopy\/endoscopy evaluation. # Hypothyroidsim: Levothyroxine continued. # ___ on CKD: Cr baseline is 1.4, of unknown etiology. Increased to max of 2.3 on ___, likely ___ aggressive diuresis given elevated bicarb and dry MM on exam. Pt given 250cc boluses, and lasix held thereafter, causing Cr to downtrend to baseline prior to discharge. # HTN: Pt hypotensive on arrival, antihypertensives held. Occasionally would become hypertensive to 160s when agitated on the vent, but required no interventions. By time of discharge, pt was restarted on home dose metoprolol XL. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =============================================== 1.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with history of rheumatic fever s\/p mitral valve replacement who presents with atypical chest pain after recent diagnosis with MSSA endocarditis. # Atypical chest pain \/ GERD: Patient has history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse, which place her at risk for cardiac events. However, onset of symptoms at rest, duration of symptoms (hours), unchanged EKG and negative x3 cardiac enzymes were not suggestive of cardiac etiology. She also had concurrent epigastric burning and choking sensation in her throat that suggested a GI source. The pain was partially relieved with GI cocktail (ranitidine, pantoprazole, maalox). She had several more episodes of similar chest pain that were improved by maalox or GI cocktail. She was started on a PPI and then this was increased to BID. She still occaisionally had this discomfort. We also started her on simethicone. The time course and the fact that it was sometimes releived with passing flatus made it also fit with gas and bloating and it was explained to her that the alterations in her gut flora and the efffects of the antibiotics may mean that she has some abdominal\/epigastric discomfort until she is done her course. Being back on probiotics when at rehab might help. # Status post mitral valve replacement - The patient's INR was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.6. She was placed on a heparin gtt and her coumadin dose was increased. Lovenox was avoided given the new renal failure. Her INR eventually increased back into the therapeutic range. She should have her INR monitored at rehab with a goal of 2.5 - 3.5, and her coumadin dose adjusted as needed. Importantly, her INR is bound to change when she has finished her rifampin. Phamrmacy posited that she might even stablize at 2.5 mg coumadin when it is stopped. They recommended halving the dose of coumadin and monitoring INR very closely until stable. # Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine was 1.7 on admission, increased from baseline of 0.9 - 1.2. FENa > 2%. Urine eos negative. Urine ultrasound and UA otherwise unremarkable. Nephrology was consulted and recommended an infectious disease consult to help with antibiotic reassessment. There were no muddy brown casts to suggest ATN and even though there was no urine eosinophils, the picture generally fit with AIN, Her naficillin was switched to cefazolin. Her renal function improved slightly while hospitalized. She should have her creatinine monitored at rehab and if it rises greater than 1.8, her nephrologist, Dr. ___ be contacted.

She has ID and cardiology follow-up scheduled. # Diarrhea - The patient was complaining of diarrhea since her previous hospital discharge. Stool test for C. difficile was negative. Diarrhea is likely secondary to antibiotic therapy. # Palmar rash- The patient came in with an erythematous pruritic rash on bilateral palms. The rash worsened a bit during the hospitalization and extended into the interdigital spaces. It is most likely a drug reaction, given its morbilliform appearance, though eczema cannot be excluded. Topical hydrocortisone and sarna lotion were given. # Anemia - Monitored, stable. Haptoglobin < 5, LDH elevated, likely hemolysis from mechanical mitral valve. # Hypertension - BP monitored, stable.

Pt was given aggressive fluid repletion initially with NS and then with ___ NS c 1.5 amps bicarb. Pt's bicarb was followed to ensure that metabolic acidosis was not entirely corrected (as metabolic acidosis is protective for hypocalcemic seizures both by raising seizure threshold and by decreasing the fraction of calcium bound to albumin). Pt's electrolytes were trended. Pt was significantly hypocalcemic but without symptoms. The calcium was not repleted as it was felt that pt would soon become significantly hypercalcemic ___ lysis of muscle cells. CK and uric acid were also trended and they slowly trended down. IVF were eventually discontinued secondary to pt's poor urine output and increasing volume overload. HIV and Hepatits serologies were negative.

We started pt on cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM injections, as well as restarting ferrous sulfate 325 mg tid for iron deficiency. #Urinary tract infection: U\/A was significant for ___ WBC and large amount of leukocyte esterase at OSH and culture was postive for greater than 100,000 CFU's of GBS. Also had an elevated WBC of 13 on admisison. It is posible that her UTI also contributed to her fatigue and weakness at admission. She was given a dose of levoquin at OSH and started on amoxacillin 500 mg q8h for seven days. #Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Pt had a positive troponin I of 0.54 at OSH and was actually transferred to ___ for further cardiac work-up. Once arriving here her troponins slowly trended upward from 0.06-->0.08-->0.09-->0.12. Pt was completely asymptomatic other than one episode of nausea during the first night of admission. Her EKG was also fairly consistent with nonspecific T wave inversions. We consulted cardiology who recommended obtaining an Echo, while stating that they did not beleive that the presentation was consistent with ACS. Echo on ___ showed severe global LV systolic dysfunction with an EF of ___. Cardiology felt that this was most consistent with a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy due to the global depression, but that the pt would likely need a cardiac catherixation as an outpt to r\/o ischemic cardiomyopathy. Her troponins stabalized at 0.18 on discharge. Based on her new diagnosis of systolic CHF, she was started on aspirin 81 mg daily, metoprolol 12.5 mg bid and valsartan 25 mg daily. #HTN: Pt with a h\/o HTN, but not on any current medications and was minimally hypertensive on this admission. She was started on metoprolol and valsartan for her dilated cardiomyopathy. #HLD: Continued lipitor 10 mg daily.

His course was complicated by post-procedural hypotension requiring pressors, IABP placement, and CCU transfer. He stabilized quickly, was transferred back to the Cardiology floor, and was discharged to rehab. . #. CAD: s\/p BMS x3 and rotoablation to LAD. He presented with worsening\/unstable angina despite medical therapy with ranolazine (he has not tolerated nitrates in the past). On ___ had PCI that revealed heavily calcified LAD with ostial 90% lesion and diffuse 70-80% stenoses in the mid and distal vessel more severe than ___. Underwent rotoablation of LAD and 3BMS to ___ LAD. Procedure was complicated by low BPs to ___ and IABP placed with dopamine and levophed gtt.

He was able to be transferred back to the Cardiology floor where his blood pressures remained stable and he was slowly restarted on his home. He continues on lifelong ASA daily and will need Clopidogrel for at least 1 month. He continues on a statin, beta blocker, ACEi, Ranolazine. His ACEi was decreased from home dose as his BP only able to tolerate lower doses. He will follow up with Dr ___ in Cardiology after discharge; he may benefit from a repeat TTE as an outpatient. . #. Hypertension: Well controlled; he did have hypotension post-cath. SBP mostly ~110 but post-cath he did have the transient hypotension requiring pressors and IABP (see above). Note that his hypotension was likely due to ischemia from distal showering of plaque during cardiac cath (especially given that his cardiac enzymes increased afterwards). In the CCU his anti-hypertensives were held but upon transfer to the Cardiology floor these were able to be added back. His Lisinopril dose was changed to 20mg daily. His Metoprolol was continued at his home dose. . #. Dementia: With delirium post-cath. Likely chronic vascular dementia.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ male with extensive cardiac PMH, recent MRSA bacteremia, trach on chronic mechanical ventilation, and chronic foley catheter with recent pseudomonal\/klebsiella UTI, who presents now from rehab with fever, leukocytosis, vomiting, and AMS in setting enterococcus and yeast UTI, ___, MRSA bacteremia, hematochezia, and Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer. . ACUTE ISSUES #. MRSA Bacteremia: Pt had recurrent MRSA bacteremia in the settting of vancomycin treatment. We are particularly concerned about endocarditis from ICD given the refractory nature. However, removal of instrumentation is not an option per patietn and family wishes. Source of infection include sacral decubitous ulcer, UTI, ventilation. Pt does not have leukocytosis or fever. Chronic colonization likely. Complete bacterial clearance is unlikely in this setting. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - START Daptomycin indefinitely - PICC line in place, routine care . #. GIB: Pt presented with HCT drop and Bright red blood through ostomy. He received a total of 3 units pRBC blood transfusion. We temporarily stopped tube feeding the setting of GIB, and discontinued his aspirin. His HCT has been stable in the past 48 hours without transfusion. GI has been consulted, and did not feel that the benefit of osteostomy-scope outweighs its risk. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - CONTINUE tube feeding as scheduled - STOP aspirin and anti-platelets forever. - START pantoprazole 40 mg iv bid - CONTINUE ferrous sulfate, sucrafate . #. ___: Pt presented with elevated Cr to 3.5 on admission with anuria. There was muddy brown cast on urine sedimentation, concerning for ATN in the setting of sepsis and tobramycin exposure. We gave him gentle fluid challenge, and his urine output recovered shortly afterwards. His creatinine decreased to 2.7 on the day of discharge. This may or may not ever go back down to his previous baseline. Regardless, he's not anuric and patient and family have refused initiation of dialysis. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - AVOID nephrotoxic medication - DISCONTINUE Lisinopril . #. Hematuria and UTI: Pt has indwelling foley catheter and presented with hematuria and positive UA. Urine culture was notable for VRE, fungus. We treated him with meropenem and fluconazole while he was in the MICU. He received bladder irrigation for hematuria. His hematuria resolved on the day of discharge. Pt was asymptomatic from his UTI. We felt it is impossible to completely treat his UTI. We decided to withdrawal treatment for now to minimize the hepatic and renal drug intoxication. . #. Decubitus ulcer: Pt has a Stage 4 decubitus ulcer over sacrum and left thigh. The pain from decubitous ulcer is his major concern while he was here. He was seen by wound care. They advise supportive care. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - Pleae CHANGE BODY POSITION every 2 hours - Please provide adequate pain management with lidocaine patch, fentanyl, oxycodone. . #. Positive sputum culture: Pt has trach tube. His sputum culture grew multiresistant klebsiella and pseudomonas. Pt remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, left shift or increased sputum production. We felt the complete irradiation was unlikey given his current clinical status and suspect he has permanent colonization. . CHRONIC ISSUES #. Chronic dCHF: Pt has diastolic CHF. We continued his beta-blocker for the need of rate control. We held his lisinopril in an hope of protecting his current kidney function. We held his aspirin in the setting of GI bleeding. We felt that active treatment for his CHF is less of a priority. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - DISCONTINUED Aspirin and all antiplatelet drugs - DISCONTINUED Lisinopril . #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt is AV paced on telemetry. Not on anticoagulation given history of GI bleeding. Rate controlled with carvedilol. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - Per our EP recommendation, they can disable the defibrillator function, while still keep AV pacing, if there is a need in the change of goal of care. . # Depression: Continue citalopram. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Pt declared a code status of DNR\/DNI. Extensive discussion has occurred between family and care provider team on goal of care. In general, our understanding is that family would like continued conservative treatment, with no invasive procedure, including the use of pressors. We have conveyed clearly to the family that clinical improvement is unlikely in the current situation. Pt's family expressed concerns that patient has not been getting enough comfort care (ie skin, wound, pain). . The wife has expressed continued frustration with being transferred back and forth from rehab to the hospital. We assured her that the care provided to him at rehab is very good. In general, we'd try to limit the number of unecessary hospitalizations. We explained to the family, with the son present in the room, that the patient's condition is stable, but ultimately is declining. We explicity told them that things are probably as good as they'll ever be, and that in the future he will have a slow and steady decline. We are limited in interventions that can be done here in hospital and have conveyed that to his family. . .","summary":"As you know, the blood stream infection is probably chronic and it would basically be impossible to cure of you that.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a ___ year old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, ovarian cancer s\/p chemo and surgical interventions, who presents with word finding difficulties and recent falls. #Subacute left globus pallidus infarct: Initial Non-contrast headache CT was negative for acute hemorrhage, and alteplase was not administered due to extended duration of symptoms and thrombectomy was not done d\/t no large vessel occlusion. MRI head w\/ contrast revealed a possible subacute infarct in left basal ganglia. Exam was notable for very subtle apraxia, neglect, and migrographia which the patient said was new. She had mild hesitancy in her speech but no aphasia. Clinically, the patient appeared to be improving, however had two episodes on ___, in which the patient experienced nausea and bradycardia (heart rate in ___, and was briefly unresponsive for a few seconds. The first of these episodes began while the patient was walking with ___, with bradycardia and unresponsiveness occurring after the patient lay down. She regained conscious within a few seconds. The second episode occurred while the patient was sitting in bed and included a 5.5 second pause on telemetry with loss of consciousness, left eye deviation, left head turning and bilateral upper extremity shaking. She regained consciousness in ~30 seconds and was noted to have new right facial droop, right upper extremity weakness, and fluent aphasia with word salad. NIHSS at this time was 10. Imaging at that time, including non-contrast head CT and CTA were unremarkable, and following CT, NIHSS improved to 5. Alteplase was not administered due fluctuating exam and rapid improvement. Exam continued to improve with only mild aphasia. EEG was done that showed mild left sided slowing but no discharges or electrographic seizures. Likely episode of eye deviation, head deviation, and upper extremity shaking iso bradycarida and sinus pause was convulsive syncope. MRI head without contrast later revealed stable subacute infarct in the left globus pallidus without any new areas of infarct or hemorrhage. Stroke risk factors include TSH 0.4, fasting lipid panel LDL 123, and HBA1c 7.7. She was started on aspirin 81mg and her simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin 40mg. Likely etiology of stokes is small vessel\/lacunar. #Cognitive Decline: Felt that likely some of her symptoms were due to overlying dementia that may have been worsening as patient lives alone and per family recently stopped taking her medications. B12 and RPR were checked and were normal. Unclear how well she has been functioning at home prior to this as she lives alone. She also has had repeated falls at home which she is unable to describe or explain. #HTN: Her hypertensive medications were held other than HCTZ to allow blood pressure to auto-regulate. She was noted to be intermittently hypertensive and her home medications were re-started. There were held again after syncope described above. Prior to discharge she was restarted on amlodipine but losartan and HCTZ were held. #Syncope: During hospitalization, as described above, she had had a series of episodes of bradycardia. During the first episode, she became unresponsive and was noted to be bradycardic to as low as the ___ on telemetry with a 3 second pause, followed by subsequent hypertension and tachycardia up to the 110 bpm range. About 10 minutes later, she had a similar episode. Finally, after she had been stabilized in bed, a third episode of bradycardia occurred with a documented 5.5 second pause and associated period of unresponsiveness. After she recovered, she had worsened aphasia, as well as weakness and facial droop, as described above. Telemetry was considered to be consistent with vagal etiology, without nodal block. She has no prior history of arrhythmias or conduction disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed normal Biventricular systolic function, no cardiac source of embolus. EP Cardiology was consulted and felt that these episodes were consistent with vasovagal and did not warrant any further investigation or intervention. We discussed worry that this episode may have caused some increased hypoperfusion and re-infarction iso new facial droop, weakness, and aphasia after syncope. EP felt that since likely vasovagual there was no indication for pacemaker as this would not prevent the vasodilation associated with vasovagual and would not prevent hypoperfusion. They felt that if highly symptomatic episodes continue even with vagal triggers minimized. In the future all nodal blockade should be avoided. She has been scheduled for cardiology follow up. She was discharged with ___ of hearts monitor. #Diabetes: Glucose was monitored throughout stay and insulin administered on sliding scale. HbgA1C 7.7.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Dr. ___ is a ___ year old woman w\/ h\/o spontaneous retinal tear admitted w\/ palpable purpura in bilateral lower extremities and right ankle swelling in the setting of Augmentin (which she started for suspected sialolithiasis and submandibular gland infection), found to have leukocytoclastic vasculitis and improved with cessation of Augmentin and initiation of prednisone. ACTIVE ISSUES: ============= #Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV): Patient presented with palpable purpura of the bilateral lower extremities with right ankle swelling. Labs notable for transaminitis and microscopic hematuria. Seen by dermatology and rheumatology and underwent skin biopsy with pathology confirming leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV). The recent history of Augmentin usage and infection is consistent with LCV. Her Augmentin was held and she was started on prednisone to which she improved. At the time of discharge, she was having resolving transaminitis, resolved microscopic hematuria, and improved ankle right pain and lower right leg swelling, although still noticing new petechiae, which can be seen in LCV despite withdrawal of offending stimulus. Continued on prednisone 20mg daily on discharge with a plan to decrease to 15mg daily after one week and follow up with rheumatology and dermatology. #Right submandibular gland swelling: Patient initially presented to an outside urgent care clinic on ___ with right submandibular gland swelling and tenderness, started empirically on Augmentin, and initially thought to have sialolithiasis with concurrent infection, which is plausible given that patient's symptoms improved with Augmentin therapy. However, given the family history of ___ and the patient's joint symptoms on her admission to ___, there was concern that her initial jaw tenderness could have been part of a broader rheumatological process and a rheumatological workup was done. At the time of discharge, her workup was notable for negative ___, negative ANCA, and negative Sjogren antibodies, and the patient's right submandibular gland swelling and tenderness had improved significantly and she was otherwise stable. She will need to follow up with ENT after discharge, and consider possible CT scan. CHRONIC ISSUES: ============== #Retinal tear: Continued home eye drops TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ================== 1.) Patient should have sutures removed on ___ from her biopsy site. 2.) If pruritus develops, dermatology recommended triamcinolone 0.1% ointment BID to affected areas - use up to two weeks per month. 3.) Patient's malignancy screening should be clarified to ensure that she is up to date 4.) Pt needs to follow up with ENT for management of the right submandibular gland swelling. Consider outpatient CT neck per ENT. 5.) Pt needs to continue prednisone 20mg daily and then decrease to 15mg daily after one week until follow up with outpatient rheumatology. 6.) Augmentin added to the allergy list. It is unclear whether patient can be exposed to penicillins in the future; can consider outpatient allergy referral 7.) Pt needs to have repeat LFTs as an outpatient. Consider further workup if not resolved # CONTACT: Sister\/HCP ___ ___ # CODE STATUS: Full (presumed)","summary":"You were hospitalized for the onset of petechiae, purpura, lower leg swelling, and ankle tenderness, predominantly on your right lower leg, in the setting of 7 days of Augmentin usage. Upon admission, you were found to have signs of mild injury to your liver and kidney. You were found to have a leukocytoclastic vasculitis and your symptoms managed with cessation of Augmentin and initiation of prednisone, to which you responded well.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ PMHx obesity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CKD III (baseline 1.4) and chronic multiple myeloma and adenocarcinoma of anal canal (dx'ed ___ presenting for AFib with RVR. ACUTE ISSUES: ------------- # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Pt presented initially with RVR in the 140s. Most likely in the setting of B-blocker and CCB being held due to hypotension. C. diff infection (see below) most likely contributing to hypotension. Pt received IV metoprolol and IV diltiazem in ED and was started on PO metoprolol\/diltiazem on floor. She was also fluid resuscitated. Patient discharged with control of afib with RVR with PO metop and diltiazem at home doses. INR was supratherapeutic and coumadin was held (see below). # Hypotension: Per nursing home, she had intermittent hypotension requiring discontinuation of her metoprolol and diltiazem. Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake\/loose stools from C.diff infection. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid use in the setting of infection was ruled out with AM cortisol (30). # Funguria, bacteruria: Pt initially reported dysuria and UA x2 showed large leuks\/bacteria\/yeast. Despite being contaminated, due to symptoms of dysuria, she was initially treated with IV CTX. Urine cultures eventually grew only yeast, prompting discontinuation of CTX. She was no longer symptomatic at this time, and she had no CVA tenderness or systemic symptoms of infection. She had a foley place initially for urine output monitoring, however, this was removed. Funguria will be treated with fluconazole for total 7 days of therapy. # C.difficile infection: Although no recent history of antibiotics, patient immunosuppressed and at rehabilitation facility. She was initially started on PO metronidazole on ___, but this was changed to PO vanc, given that she is immunosuppresed and falls into the severe category. ___, ___. # Coagulopathy: INR on admission was 6.5. Most likely secondary to decreased PO ntake and exacerbated antibiotics. No active signs of bleeding. Once INR reached 7.8, she was given 2.5 mg PO vitamin K. She received additional 2.5 mg PO vitamin K on ___. Coumadin was held on discharge. # Acute on chronic CKD (stage 3): Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.8-1.1). Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake and decreased cardiac output from afib with RVR. Creatinine improved with IVF. # Lower extremity edema: Multi-factorial. Most likely venous stasis vs diastolic heart failure, especially in the setting of afib with RVR, vs hypoalbuminemia. Pa\/lateral film in ED showed no cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascualar congestion to suggest decompensated systolic heart failure. Pt on furosemide at home. Albumin was 3.0. Furosemide held on admission due to ___. Edema was managed with pneumatic boots. Furosemide was restarted at 40 mg on discharge. # UPJ obstruction s\/p stent placement ___ c\/b persistent Klebsiella bacteruria: Pt scheduled for stent replacement soon. She had no CVA tenderness on exam and creatinine was stable after IVF. Pt was scheduled to have stent replaced on ___, but procedure was cancelled due to supratherapeutic INR. Per Urology, pt's INR needs to be <3.0 and she will need this procedure in the next ___ months. # Troponinemia: Most likely strain from RVR vs decreased clearance in the setting of ___. Peaked at 0.02 before downtrending. # Hyperlactatemia: Lactate 2.6 on admission. Most likely secondary to dehydration versus ineffective cardiac output from RVR. Peaked at 2.6 before downtrending. CHRONIC ISSUES: --------------- # Weakness: She had generalized total body weakness, with the lower extremities worse than upper extremities. Also with the left ___ greater than right ___. No documented previous CVA to which asymmetry can be attributed. Most likely deconditioning and myopathy from dexamethasone, versus myositis or cerebrovascular event, both thought unlikely. CK was within normal limits. ___ worked with patient and she was discharged back to rehab. # Leg pain: Most likely osteoarthritis. She does not have diabetes to suggest neuropathy. She continued home oxycodone 10 mg qHS. # Pancytopenia: Patient with stable neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia improved from prior, thought to be secondary to lenalidomide as well as anemia of chronic disease. # Anal adenocarcinoma: Diagnosed recently in ___.

We discussed this at length with him, and he shared that since age ___ he has been consuming a heavy quantity of alcohol. The pt has experienced both 'manic' and 'depressive' sx in the past but those were in the context of etoh or cocaine intake. Therefore, we did not believe the pt has a primary mood d\/o and we encouraged him to gain sobriety and continue to f\/u for assessments of his mood.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo man with chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD s\/p stents on plavix and aspirin, and history of rectal cancer s\/p resection and ostomy reconstruction, presents with anemia and dark stools. 1) Anemia\/GI bleed: On presentation the patient was anemic with melena, but he was hemodynamically stable and relatively asymptomatic. Hematocrit on presentation was 26.1 so he was not immediately transfused, but he did have large bore IV's inserted and received fluid boluses. He was also started on BID PPI therapy and his anticoagulants (aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin) were held. His second hematocrit had dropped to 23.3, but as there was not a great deal of stool or blood in his ostomy bag this was presumed to be more consistent with dilution than continued brisk bleeding. Still, at that time transfusion was offered, but the patient was quite reluctant and as he continued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic transfusion was held. As the day progressed hematocrit rose back to 25 and remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization. Gastroenterology was consulted on the day after presentation and planned to take the patient for EGD after allowing the INR to fall for a day. Unfortunately, the INR remained elevated, but at that point gastroenterology elected to proceed with EGD with a plan not to do any interventions unless their was overt, active bleeding. On EGD the patient had gastritis and duodenitis but no ulcers or obvious other sources of bleeding. ___, no intervention was performed and the patient was discharged on BID PPI and with a reduced anticoagulant regimen to follow up in GI clinic. Stools at discharge were non-melenic. Hematocrit was greater than 25. 2) CAD s\/p BMS ___: The patient has history of coronary artery disease and had bare metal stents placed in ___. Nevertheless, he never had chest pain or other signs of active ischemia. His aspirin and clopidogrel were held on presentation due to concern for active bleeding. At discharge he was restarted on warfarin and aspirin but as it was greater than one year out from his stent placement it was considered safe to hold clopidogrel at discharge in order to decrease the number of anticoagulants the patient was taking. The patient's cardiologist, Dr ___, was made aware of this decision and thought it was reasonable. 3)Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35% by previous echocardiograms but never showed signs of acute volume overload or evidenced dyspnea in the hospital. Initially, his aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic were held in the context of potentially active bleeding and concern about hemodynamic stability. These were all restarted prior to discharge. 4)HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension but was never frankly hypertensive in the hospital. His anti-hypertensives were initially held in the hospital and then restarted as described in the previous problem point. 5)Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient is on metoprolol for rate control and warfarin for stroke prevention. His rate remained relatively well controlled even when metoprolol was being held. His warfarin was held on presentation but restarted after his procedure. His INR never became subtherapeutic. He will follow up with his PCP for further INR monitoring. As the patient was systemically anticoagulated no further DVT prophylaxis was given. He was on BID PPI for GI bleed. He tolerated a full diet prior to discharge. He was full code.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you were bleeding into your gastrointestinal tract so that blood was showing up in your colostomy bag.

Course complicated by AMS due to delirium, A fib with RVR, and pseudomonal infection. She was transferred to the floor on ___. Floor course was remarkable for wound dehiscence, continued afib with occasional RVR and ongoing delirium. # Hypotension: Most likely due to volume loss (8hr procedure with persistent oozing) compounded by third spacing from SIRS DIC response with hypoalbuminemia and anesthesia with delayed renal clearance and finaly RVR with poor filling time. Estimated blood loss was 1L though poorly quantified given the extent of the procedure. Intraop she received 6L crystalloid, 4 PRBC, and albumin (by report though unable to find in OMR), and her post op crit nevertheless dropped from 32 to 22. Post op bleeding possible with DIC (INR 1.2->2.4) and thrombocytopenia nadir 39, though there are no outward signs of blood loss- hemostasis was noted at closure, the incisions have been dry with no significant drains putting out appropriate though dark serosanguanous fluid.

Patient was empirically covered with vanc\/zosyn briefly, though this was discontinued given no clear source of infection. Patient experienced recurrent hypotension on ___ after returning from OR on ___. This was felt to be due to intra-operative blood loss and fluid shifts. She received 1U PRBCs on ___ intra-operatively and again on ___ due to drop in H\/H. BP improved with IVF bolus, blood transfusions, and improved control of A fib with RVR. # DIC: INR rose 1.2-> 2.4, platelets dipped to 39 with occasionaly schistos. This is likely from the procedure, no evidence of infection, and it appears to have responded to FFP with stable fibrinogen not requiring cryo. No evidence of petichiae, no appreciable oozing from lines and wounds. SQ heparin was discontinued, then restarted on ___ once platelets > 50. Thrombocytopenia improved during ICU course. It gradually resolved and normalized by ___. # Afib: Previously on warfarin and rate controlled with dilt, bridged with lovenox and dilt recently decreased to 120 due to soft systolics during previous admission. Patient was controlled with dilt gtt and was also briefly on amiodarone.

Discontinued PICC ___ and patient was not anticoagulated, after discussion with surgery and heme\/onc the decision was not to anti-coagulate due to ongoing wound complications and poor overall prognosis. #AMS: most likely secondary to ICU delirium with waxing and waning mental status. Mental status improved significantly during ICU course and patient was placed on seroquel qhS PRN. This was continued while on the floor. Her mentation did not improve much and has ongoing delirium. # Lactic acidosis: Combination of tissue disruption from surgery and hypoperfusion from above. Lactate improved with improved BP. #nutrition: patient with low albumin and pre-albumin levels with poor nutrtional status likely contributing to poor wound healing. She was restarted on TFs post-operatively when cleared by surgery. She was seen by ___ who recommended soft solids and thin liquids, along with supplemental tube feeds.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Pt. was admitted to the Stroke service after an episode where she felt dizzy and off-balance and like she had \"jello legs.\" Initial head CT was read as concerning for some areas of hemorrhage around her known L frontotemporal AVM, but on attending review it was felt that this was actually a combination of blood pooling in dilated vessels, embolic material, some degree of vascular calcification, and perhaps hemosiderin staining of the brain (i.e the by-products of the radiation she'd received to the AVM). An MRI of the head was performed to rule out posterior circulation infarct, and was negative for any evidence of acute ischemia (see report above) . A random Dilatin trough in the ED was 20, and on further review with her in the morning she reported the symptoms started about 90 minutes after taking her 300 mg evening dose of Dilantin. On exam the next morning she had coarse bilateral end-gaze nystagmus and gait ataxia which were both felt to be c\/w Dilantin toxicity. Dilantin trough the next morning was 20 (corrected to 26.4 given Albumin of 3.4) She reported that in the last 2 weeks she had started a statin, and had taken 2 different antibiotics for pneumonia (Cipro and another she couldn't remember). It was felt that these added medications were changing her Dilantin metabolism. Her afternoon and evening doses were held, and on HOD #2 her trough was down to 15. Her gait was much improved.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Atypical meningioma: Patient presented with an episode of syncope that most likely represented seizure given brain mass on MRI (per niece, did not actually occur on the toilet, episode occurred while patient seated at dinner table, making vasovagal syncope less likely). Cardiogenic causes also less likely, given her atrial fibrillation has been stable without any rate control agents (unclear if this is new). No evidence of infection as predisposing factor. Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF. She did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms. MRI brain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the interhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an atypical meningioma. ___ discussed with niece; patient would not want surgical intervention. She was started Keppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient neuro follow-up. # A. fib: Paroxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC score 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, decision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, and intracranial lesion. Location makes saggital sinus vulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed. Niece in agreement with decision. # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, resolved today. Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work up unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear). It is possible that she aspirated during her syncopal event. # ___: Cr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with hydration. Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts and resolution with IVF. CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # Autoimmune hepatitis The patient was continued on her home prednisone # Hypertension The patient was continued on her home nifedipine # Alzheimer's dementia The patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout this hospitalization. She was Continued on her home donepezil and memantine. # CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed) # CONTACT: ___ ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric fissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical meningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's niece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on Keppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up with her neurologist as an outpatient - Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this admission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for rate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated given her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of her atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life expectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on her home aspirin 81 mg PO QD. - If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider starting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol succinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital after having what was most likely a seizure.

Pt was found to have T12 mass concerning for malignancy in ___, however bx of mass and BM was inconclusive. She was asymptomatic at that time and family decided not to persue further work-up. Pt now p\/w with a 2.5 month h\/o of progressive weakness and recurrent falls unresponsive to ___, and weight loss from 250-->225. Pt had CT at OSH which demonstrated expanding lesion at T12 and was subsequently given 10mg IV dexamethasone and transfered to ___ for further management. Patient arrived on the floor afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Immediate neurology and neurosurgery consults were obtained. Her hospitalization course is as follows: # T12 lesion: Patient has profound lower extremity weakness bilaterally, some of which is baseline from her previous CVA. Her right sided neuro exam is notable for hyperreflexia and clonus which is likely left over from her distant stroke. She was continued on dexamethasone and ISS while on the high dose steroids. The patient was also given a TLSO brace for ambulation (although initially in too much pain to ambulate), and the head of her bed was kept at <45 degrees. She received a pre-op myelogram, consistent with an expanding T12 lesion from prior imaging. She was subsequently taken for decompression surgery by Ortho-Spine Team (s\/p T10-L2 fusion, T12 Corpectomy) and transferred to the Ortho-Spine service for post-op management for two days. When she returned to the medicine service on POD2, the patient was unable to move her lower extremities bilaterally. Ortho-spine service indicated that the patient required additional pain control. After consult with Neuro-Onc, the patient was transitioned from dexamethasone 10mg Q8 hours to dexamethasone 4mg BID on POD4. She was transferred to the Neurology service for better management of her leg weakness. It was felt this was likely due to post-op pain and inability for her to express her pain level due to her aphasia. Her medications were titrated and she did better on a higher dose fentanyl patch with immediate release morphine and tylenol for breaththrough pain. Subsequently her leg movements improved on better pain control. She will require XRT for her other bony lesions, and will need to follow up in ___ clinic after XRT (to be arranged by XRT). # FED\/GI: Patient was found to initially have very mild hypercalcemia on admission. She was NPO for procedure and started on maintenence fluids overnight however did not require agressive IVF. At the time of surgery, her hypercalcemia resolved. She was advanced to a dysphagia diet post-operatively and did well on that for the rest of her course. Electrolytes were stable with the exception of potassium which kept returning falsely elevated from hemolosis when drawn off her PICC. # Foot Fracture: The patient was found to have R foot fracture involving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx with extension to the fifth MTP joint. This was consistent with repeat imaging at ___. Her L foot and ankles were also imaged because the pt was complaining of additional pain, however, films did not reveal any additional acute fractures. The feet were vascularly intact. Orthopedics recommended a hard sole boot for when the patient became ambulatory, otherwise, no intervention necessary. # Pain: Patient was found in extreme pain when transfered back to medicine service on POD2. Unclear of origin as patient has difficulty communicating due to her aphasia. Patient's pain was controlled with standing acetaminophen, oxycodone, oxycontin, fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV PRN. The pain team was also consulted to help manage her pain. She was able to come off the oxycontin on a higher dose of fentanyl patch, and had PO ___ oxycodone and tylenol for break through pain. # Encephalopathy: On POD2, there was noted an increase in aphasia, and confusion, which was difficult to assess given baseline communication issues. HCHCT for acute bleed was negative. The Pt was afebrile and infectious work-up including UA was neg. Urine Ctx and blood ctx were negaitve for occult infection. Her mental status improved with better pain control. She got a little worse on ___ and was subsequently found to have a new UTI (E Coli), which improved after treating with first ceftriaxone and then Bactrim when sensitivies returned pan-sensitive. # Hct Drop: The patient Hct dropped from 32 on POD1-->22 on POD2, Hemavac drained only 185cc, pt responded appropriately to 2U PRBC. Unclear where bleed is. Patients Hct subsequent remained stable after transfusion. A T&L MRI revealed: \"Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection communicates through the laminectomy defect and causes anterior and left lateral displacement of the thecal sac. This leads to severe encroachment on the distal spinal cord. There are no findings to suggest tumor in this location. The signal intensity characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather than hemorrhage.\" Her Hct remained stable and the ultimate source of her Hct drop was never identified but felt to be possibly due to post-op hemolysis. The fluid collection was discussed with ortho spine service who felt it could be conservatively watched for now (likely just post-surgical changes). # History of Stroke: The patient was continued on home dose of aggrenox until the time of her surgery. When the patient was transfered back to Medicine on POD2, the aggrenox was held. It was restarted on ___ at the consent of orthopedics team. # HTN: The patient was continued on home dose of losartan, diltiazem and atenolol # HLD: The patient was continued on her home dose of pravastatin # ID: UTI discovered ___eveloped foul smelling urine and WBC bumped to 22 (but this was felt to partially be due to her dexamethasone as well). Treated with first Ceftriaxone, then Bactrim, and culture grew out pan-sensitive E Coli. # Access: Pt had a PICC line placed and confirmed in good position early on in her hopspitalization. Due to initial concerns with dysphagia and patient frequently spitting out her meds, we decided to keep her steroids IV to ensure she received this crucial medication post-operatively. Once she has started radiation therapy, however, the PICC may come out and the IV steroids may be converted to the PO form.","summary":"You were admitted for surgery to remove a lesion in your thoracic spine, and then was transferred to the Neurology service for leg weakness after the surgery.

Clozaril was stopped at OSH given concern for pancreatitis. Agitation was originally managed with IV haldol in the ICU, but the patient developed muscle rigidity and near-catatonia with perseveration. Psych was consulted, who felt that his presentation was consistent with malignant catatonia and was likely secondary to cessation of clozaril. He was started on IV ativan but his catatonia appeared to be refractory to benzodiazpine treatment. He was then started on a regimen of ECT ___. Amantadine was added at 100mg po BID. With these measures, his catatonia resolved. He received 8 total sessions of ECT while inpatient at ___. His amantadine was weaned to 100mg daily, and his ativan was left at 2mg po every 8 hours. On discharge the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time with occasional confusion about date and hospital name. He will need maintenance ECT therapy weekly on ___ for an indeterminate amount of time. His outpatient psychiatrist has been closely involved. His next treatment is at ___ on ___. ***Ativan should be held past midnight on scheduled ECT days. # Acute respiratory failure - Patient had stridorous respirations at the OSH. He was found to have a 6x3 cm hardened, dark brown material c\/w hardened or dried oral secretion, which was removed. He remained stridorous after the procedure and was intubated for concern of airway protection, which was performed ___ prior to transfer. CXR showed no infiltrates and no pulmonary edema. Here he was successfully extubated on ___ and was stable for a week. He was called-out to the floor on ___, and within two hours was stridorous, and a respiratory code was called. He was re-intubated and bronchoscopy revealed mucous plug and thick secretions. He was started on vanc\/cefipime and was extubated about 12 hours later. Antibiotics were d\/c'd two days later because infection was not suspected. He was transferred back to the MICU again to await ECT given concern for decreased airway protection in his catatonic state. He was intubated by anesthesia with rocuronium on ___ prior to first ECT session. Remained intubated for several hours following procedure given his h\/o difficult intubation. Patient was transitioned back to the medical floor on ___ with stable respiratory status. On the night of ___ he became febrile to ___ and developped respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather. An interval Chest X-ray was suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. He was transferred back to the MICU in the morning of ___, where he was intubated and sedated. Broad spectrum antibiotics were given. His respiratory status improved over several days, and his fevers resolved. His respiratory culture was positive for MRSA, so antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomycin monotherapy. He was exubated on ___, and was progressively weaned to 2L nasal cannula. Once called out to the medical floor, the patient re-spiked a fever so cefepime was added back on with vanc to complete a total 7 day course for aspiration PNA (ending ___. Patient was weaned to room air. The patient was made strict NPO due to aspiration risk. S&S was consulted who recommended a dysphagia diet. Pt was also started on tube feeds while PO intake was limited. Nutrition and speech and swallow continued to follow. Eventually, he passed speech and swallow eval and was able to advance to a regular diet. Tube feeds were then discontinued. It is felt that the patient's aspiration event was likely secondary to airway edema from multiple intubations, and that his edema has healed over time with subsequent improvement in ability to protect his airway. He was discharged on a regular diet, on room air, and without any respiratory concerns. Nutrition should continue to follow his caloric intake. Aspiration precautions should be enforced. # Acute pancreatitis c\/b pseudocyst, necrosis, and sinistral portal hypertension - Etiology appears to be biliary source although clozapine was considered as a pharmacalogic etiology. ERCP did not show gallstones and only sludge. Now s\/p ERCP x2 at ___. Initially a plastic stent was placed which migrated. It was removed and a metal stent was placed on ___. LFTs and Tbili improved during hospitalization. Repeat CT Abdomen ___ revealed massive splenomegaly concerning for sinitral portal hypertension. Hepatobiliary surgery and Hepatology were consulted and felt that splenectomy was not indicated at this time. They recommend follow up with Dr. ___ (___) in 2 months with follow up CT abd\/pelvis and elective CCY. Because of the patient's prolonged hospitalization, ERCP was consulted to evaluate the patient for stent removal. A CT pancreatic protocol was performed on ___ to evaluate the stent. The stent appeared occluded but due to the patient's lack of symptoms and normal LFTs, it was decided to defer stent removal and have the patient see ERCP in clinic in 1 month. He will need to see both ERCP and Dr. ___ in approximately 4 weeks time. # Acute kidney injury - Prerenal versus contrast induced nephropathy from multiple CT scans. Resolved with IV fluids. # Type 2 diabetes - Pt was taking Januvia at home but this was stopped in the setting of acute pancreatitis. Hyperglycemia was attributed to pancreatitis. The patient was started on a humalog sliding scale and lantus, which was uptitrated throughout his hospital course as needed (with fluctuation in his po intake and tube feeds). On discharge, his lantus dose was 40 units at dinner time. This should continue to be titrated based on fasting AM and QACHS fingersticks. # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets remained in the low 100s throughout hospitalization. Presentation not c\/w HIT. Heparin therapy was continued. Attributed to splenomegaly. # Frequent falls - Pt unstable and with psychiatric limitations. He had multiple falls in the hospital despite strict fall precautions.

Her hypoxia resolved by the time she arrived on the floor without recurrence during the rest of her hospitalization. # Acute renal failure: Renal team considered pre-renal vs. ATN as etiology of her renal failure. Abdominal US without hydronephrosis. Hepatorenal a possibility, but a diagnosis of exclusion per ICU team. The patient had low UOP on the night of admission and was given lasix 80 mg IV with a fair response. Renal suggested albumin 25g BID in order to increase her oncotic pressure. UOP rose to ___ cc per hour on the day of transfer to the floor. On the floor, she was treated for hepatorenal syndrome and her Cr slowly improved (peak 4.0 --> 1.4). Albumin and octreotide were eventually stopped with continuation of midodrine given SBP 90's. Pt's creatinine increased again to 2.5 with fevers raising concern for worsening HRS in setting of infection. Renal was consulted, and felt that urinary sedimentation was most consistent with ATN although prerenal problems and HRS could contribute. She was Midodrine was continued and octreotide restarted. She again received albumin 25mg IV BID from ___ to ___ for HRS in setting of presumed SBP (see 'fevers' below). Her kidney function improved and Cr was 2.2 on discharge. She will require close outpatient follow up of kidney function and has labs ordered for ___ which will be followed up by her PCP.

She was given 5mg p.o vitamin K prior to discharge for reversal and her INR should be followed up by her PCP on her labs of ___. . # Altered mental status: The patient had altered mental status on admission. Possible etiologies included hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and delirium due to metabolic causes. She was started on rifaxamin in addition to her lactulose. Her mental status improved on the day of transfer to the floor. She continued to have minor asterixis on the day of transfer, but was more alert and oriented. On the floor, her asterixis resolved and she remained AOx3 without recurrence of encephalopathy. She was continued on lactulose and rifaximin. # Alcohol induced hepatitis\/hepatic cirrhosis - acute decompensation likely precipitated by relapsed alcohol abuse. Her LFTs improved since admission. Hepatic encephalopathy resolved. EGD ___ with erosive gastritis and portal hypertensive gastropathy but no varices. She was continued on lactulose and rifaximin. Diuretics were held given her renal failure and can be restarted as outpatient.

Was not hypotensive in MICU. Obvious cause is group C strep bacteremia, likely source is L toe ulcer that is also growly group C strep. Neck pain was concerning for abscess, but MRI here did not show evidence of this, patient continued to refuse any further neck imagining despite continued decreased ROM of his neck. Given bacteremia, TTE was done which was negative, however, TEE was performed showing evidence of an aortic valve vegetation. Group C strep was found to be ceftriaxone sensitive from the OSH. In addition, patient had shoulder washout on admission to the hospital, cultures from that continued to be no growth to date. Patient was treated with ceftriaxone, and sent home for a total of 6 weeks of therapy (PICC line placed while inhouse). He was hemodynamically stable throughout his admission. . # L foot ulcer: Patient had non-healing ulcer, swab positive for group C strep, and this likely represents the source of his bacteremia. He was followed by podiatry and vascular surgery in house. He had two bedside debridements by podiatry. He additionally had non-invasive arterial studies that were normal with good flow. He will be followed by Dr. ___ in podiatry as an outpatient.

He is now s\/p washout by ortho though no growth from joint fluid. He has a history of gout, but an acute gouty flare in this joint is uncommon without multiple other joints being affected and the findings of pus on washout is also inconsistent with gout. Also concern over persistent neck pain and evolving abscess or seeding as above. He was continued on ceftriaxone for a total of 6 weeks as above. He refused any further head or neck imaging throughout his stay. . # Acute renal failure: Patient with creatinine bump from 0.8 to 1.2 overnight during admission. Baseline prior since admission appears to be around 0.6-0.8. Patient maintained good UOP until his last day of admission at which time he had urinary urgency and hesitancy with a positive bladder scan. He did have bilateral hydro on an OSH renal US, and a repeat renal US was performed showing unchanged mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis. As the patient had difficulty urinating, likley due to BPH, he was sent home with a foley\/leg bag with urology follow up as he refused to stay any longer for further work up. UA, ucx and urine eos were negative. Creatinine decreased to baseline prior to discharge. . # Transaminitis: Found on admission, resolved without intervention. Unclear etiology. Most concerning was that the patient may be throwing septic emboli. Otherwise, etiologies included congestion from sepsis, drug induced hepatitis (although level of transaminitis is quite low), CBD pathology (but TB is wnl). Most likely secondary to dehydration from evolving sepsis on admission. Abd ultrasound done was c\/w fatty liver or other liver disease which cannot be excluded, though no evidence of emboli. . # Hyponatremia: On admission. Resolved after hydration.

Patient also denied chest pain. Food poisoning or gastroenteritis also unlikely in the absence of diarrhea or abdominal pain, and her symptoms were different from presentation of norovirus in ___. In the setting of newly found adnexal mass, weight loss, and ? early satiety, a paraneoplastic gastroparesis is a possible. Most likely, however, pt was dehydrated as she admits to minimal water intake, had lactate of 5.7 that improved to 1.7 with IVF, and symptoms also resolved after receiving 2.5L IVF. In addition, patient was orthostatic on admission by heart rate, further pointing to volume depletion. She was no longer orthostatic by the time of discharge. # Ovarian lesion. Pt found to have lesion on left adnexa on CT abd\/pelvis. Follow up transvaginal ultrasound also concerning for malignancy. Patient asymptomatic. Patient was told that ultrasound was not finalized at the time of discharge, but malignancy was on the differential.

No new medications as potential cause. Heme malignancy unlikely given normal Hct and platelet and normal differential. This was likely partially due to hemoconcentration as all cell lines trended down after IVF. WBC on discharge was 14.5. # HTN. Orthostatic by heart rate but not blood pressure on admission. Initially held amilodipine and HCTZ. Patient slightly hypertensive on morning of the day of discharge, BP 140\/70s. Restarted amlodipine, but held HCTZ in the setting of its likely contributing to volume depletion. # HLD. Continued home does simvastatin. # T2DM. Pt takes Metformin at home, reports that she is moderately well-controlled, improving more recently. Last hemoglobin A1C 7.5 in ___, down from 7.9 prior. Held Metformin and placed on HISS in the hospital in case of imaging with contrast. Restarted home does metformin at the time of discharge. # Transitional issues: Code status- full - Follow up- with PCP, ___ 3 days of discharge - L. adenexal mass- high concern for malignancy, but patient currently asymptomatic. She will need expedited outpatient workup - Follow up leukocytosis as outpatient - Follow up final blood culture results","summary":"You were admitted to the ___ from ___ to ___ for nausea, vomiting, sweats, and weakness. Your symptoms were most likely due to dehydration. Your EKG and cardiac enzymes showed that you did NOT have a heart attack. You were given IV fluids, which helped to resolve your symptoms.

She had some evidence of volume overload on CXR and physical exam, in the setting of discontinuation of her furosemide for the past week or so as well as atrial fibrillation prior to admission. Her furosemide was stopped by her cardiologist due to concern for overdiuresis and elevated creatinine. Her history of increasing DOE over the past 3 days is congruent with this timeline. She was diuresed with IV furosemide on admission with robust response of over 3L negative. In addition to restarting her PO furosemide at 40mg (her previous dosing), IV diuresis was continued until the patient was more comfortable, titrated off supplemental O2, and physical exam had minimal crackles. She was also continued on her anti-heart failure medications, including her B-blocker and ___, with good blood pressure control as well. Her previous dose of Lasix 40mg was restarted on discharge and she was instructed to weigh herself each day to monitor any evidence of fluid overload and report to her MD if there were significant changes. . # RHYTHM \/ atrial fibrillation: She was admitted on metoprolol and digoxin for rate control, after a failed previous cardioversion.

Looking back through her previous INRs, her last subtherapeutic INR was in ___, making her a possible candidate for trial of rhythm control. TSH was also checked and normal. . # Acute kidney injury: Along with diuresis, we noted a mild increase in her creatinine. Given her continued symptoms of volume overload, we continued her daily diuresis with her home dose of furosemide, with creatinine peaking to 1.5, but trending down to 1.3 on discharge. We decide to tolerate this mild renal failure to try to prevent future CHF exacerbation. . # ?Obstructive sleep apnea: - Given that the patient was effectively diuresed and continued to have shortness of breath in the middle of the night, we believe that an OSA work-up as an outpatient is indicated. She has the body habitus that makes her higher risk and this is somewhat of a chronic complaint for her. She does indicate that she has undergone a sleeping study before, but states that this was quite a long time ago. . # CORONARIES \/ chest pain: Negative stress test back in ___, without significant EKG changes or cardiac enzyme elevation on admission. Her cardiac enzymes were negative x3 and she was ruled out for MI.

An EEG was done initially because there was a thought you might be having seizures, but there was just some \"spike\" activity without seizure recorded. A trial of Keppra was done but was stopped because it did not help your clinical picture. On your third hospital day, you developed what appeared to be worsening weakness on your right side, and so a CT\/ with angiogram was done to evaluate the blood vessels in the brain. There were no changes on the CT, but the angiogram showed a possible plaque in the internal carotid artery that could have sent small clots up into the smaller vessels in the brain. An ultrasound of the carotid artery was done and was limited by motion, but did not show evidence of a plaque that could throw clots. A lumbar puncture was done to rule out any infections, and was within normal limits.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, including lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening intrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous liver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon cancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and eventually discharged home with hospice. Active Issues: (1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary embolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission demonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic cancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which had evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient reluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy ultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following discussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was transferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential trial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional and nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with the patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus goals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient was discharged home with home hospice. (2) Left thigh weakness\/spinous tenderness: She was found to have focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse spinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of preserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted to be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying malignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord involvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural abscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin\/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite frequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at lumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing claustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable. (3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain and tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for obstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, particularly given episodes of emesis\/hematemesis as below. While multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen was planned to evaluate for alternative sources of intraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple occasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol as needed. (4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small volume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with blood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit remained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of PPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was true blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of recurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. (5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered throughout admission, never oriented to more than person and place, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as compared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including blood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent CXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for acute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia\/MRI aversion as above. ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. History of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. Hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic lesions to liver and asterixis on exam. AMS could also be ___ to severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained stable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge. (6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset shortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was negative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could not be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal infiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against acute coronary syndrome. Low voltages on EKG were consistent with prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. Shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission without dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers and expectorants as needed. (7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked at 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting underlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up including CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was unrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of isolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. (8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ to ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin 2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed intraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she declined CT for further evaluation. (9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout admission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant infiltration. (10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic 100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO intake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. Tachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear infectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of admission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she was never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above. (11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and seeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying depression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and treatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal ideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly prior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held preprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was seen by social work throughout admission. (12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and consistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout admission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the basis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with the exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active bleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above. (13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect synthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of malignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above. Transitional Issues: -Patient discharge home with home hospice","summary":"As you know, you were admitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying cancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath resolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh and abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further investigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your liver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver and lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were transferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately chemotherapy would do more harm for you than good. After a long discussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided that you will go home to be with your family and loved ones.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with h\/o DM, HTN, CAD s\/p CABG, recent ICU stay for necrotizing pancreatitis (___), which was complicated by respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, fevers, bacteremia (CNS, enterococcus), prolonged ileus, ___ and drug reactions, transferred to ___ on ___ from ___ at family's request with septic shock requiring pressors, hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ___, and cardiac ischemia. # Sepsis\/Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Over the course of the hospitalization, necrotizing pancreatitis and the associated inflammatory and infectious cascades were presumed to be the primary pathophysiologic etiology of the patient's presentation and clinical course. Was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support in line with early goal directed therapy. Source control with broad spectrum antibiotics as outlined below was instituted, tailoring antimicrobial coverage to cultures accordingly and progressively discontinuing antibiotics as the patient stabilized in a step-wise fashion once surveillance cultures were persistently negative. Once the septic picture showed signs of resolving, the patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix GTT and transitioned to Lasix IV boluses; over the course of diuresis his respiratory function steadily improved. . # Fever \/ leukocytosis \/ infectious source control: ID was consulted on admission and followed throughout the hospitalization course. Was covered initially very broadly with a combination of colistin\/aztreonam\/flagyl\/vancomycin PO\/daptomycin\/fluconazole, with daptomycin started in response to enterococcus species. Aztreonam\/amikacin\/colistin\/vancomycin PO were promptly discontinued and the patient was transitioned to amikacin, desensitized to cefepime and started started on cefepime. Amikacin was then discontinued and a regimen of daptomycin\/cefepime\/metronidazole\/fluconazole was continued for about 3 weeks until the patient began to stabilize and cultures were negative at which point fluconazole was discontinued, followed by metronidazole, followed by daptomycin, and finally cefepime. Other than a gram negative species that grew out of the left pseudocyst in late ___ and the entrococcus species already mentioned, which was thought to likely be a contaminant by ID, all other cultures were negative, including cultures of catheter tips and ascitic fluid. Leukocytosis showed a general trend toward improvement with intermittent lability as did the patient's temperature; cultures taken at the time of spikes were repeatedly negative. The etiology of the spikes remained unclear but it was hypothesized that inflammatory mediators from a sterile cyst could be triggering febrile episodes; it could also not be ruled out that the untapped midline cyst may be infected and transiently seeding the blood. Drug reaction, in particulary to cefepime and lasix was also considered. . # Pancreatic pseudocysts: ___ successfully placed a catheter in the patient's lateral pseudocyst; culture data as above. Serial imaging showed some slight decrease in size in the cyst but no significant change. The midline cyst was not amenable to ___ drainage; GI consult was obtained for endoscopic drainage, but intervention was deferred given the potential risks and complications in an otherwise critical patient. General surgery was also consulted for the duration of the hospitalization; surgery was deferred and the recommendation was made to continue the drains until follow-up with outpatient General Surgery ___ weeks after discharge to rehab, but upon repeat CT imaging immediately prior to discharge, the recommendation was made to pull the lateral pancreatic cyst in light of it being smaller in size and to continue the LLQ ascitic drain; the LLQ drain was subsequently discontinued prior to discharge. The patient was scheduled for a repeat CT and follow-up with Dr. ___ in late ___ prior to discharge; he was also scheduled for a follow-up with Dr. ___ ___. #. Respiratory Failure \/ Tracheostomy: Intubated at an outside hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure. CMV\/AC was maintained and titrated to ABGs per the usual ICU protocol in conjunction with appropriate IV sedation. Given the patient's anticipated protracted ventilator dependence and difficult weaning course, the decision was made to place a tracheostomy, which was performed by thoracic surgery without complication circa ___, as dated by his thoracic surgery pre-op note. The cuff initially leaked intermittently, but after minor repositioning at the bedside functioned appropriately without further issues. The patient was progressively weaned to PS and ventilator mask as tolerated as his respiratory status improved in conjunction with his overall clinical improvement as a result of the interventions detailed above. Prior to discharge he was breathing comfortably on trach mask 24 hours a day. He had an episode of delerium late in his hospitalization the weekend prior to discharge which resulted in him pulling out his tracheostomy, but it was replaced without complication at the bedside and he subsequently had no further episodes. Speach and swallow consulted late in the hospitalization to fit a Passy-Muir valve, but was unsuccessful and it was thought that this was due to the transient inflammation caused by the aforementioned episode of removing and replacing his tracheostomy. Of note, he was phonating the day of discharge without the Passy-Muir valve. He will likely benefit from downsizing of his cuff once in rehab. #. Left Sided Pleural Effusion: Noted early in the hospitalization that the patient had a left sided pleural effusion. This effusion was not tapped in the setting acute instability and subsequently managed conservatively without tapping as the patient stabilized from a respiratory perspective with the hypothesis that it would progressively shrink with diuresis. The etiology was thought to be trans-diaphagramatic ascites. # Anasarca \/ Volume overload: Iatrogoenic from fluid resuscitation and steadily improved with Lasix GTT followed by Lasix Bolus IV which was then transitioned to PO in conjunction with the patient's autodiuresis. Diuresis was titrated to remain within the patient's hemodynamic limits during the period of labile hypotensive episodes and then titrated to Cr when the patient was more hemodynamically unstable. On discharge he was NEGATIVE 21 LITERS from admission and 96KG from 128KG on admission. In the days prior to discharge, was transitioned from Lasix to PO Torsemide, which was titrated to 30mg daily. # Ascites: Paracentesis fluid consistent with exudative process likely due to necrotizing pancreatitis. Underwent paracentesis with drain placement. The drain was discontinued prior to discharge and the patient was scheduled for follow-up with Dr. ___. # HYPO-tensive episodes, Labile blood pressures part 1 of 2: Multifactorial, initially due in large part to septic physiology, but also complicated by a borderline abdominal-compartment syndrome in the setting of pancreatitis. Hypotension was responsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation and source control in conjunction with pressors but SBP remained labile into the ___ until the abdomen became less tense, with peak bladder pressures ranging in the ___. Abdominal compartment syndrome resolved with paracentesis and drain placement as well as diuresis. In turn, hypotensive episodes also resolved. # HYPER-tensive episodes, Labile blood pressures part 2 of 2: Coincident with hypotensive episodes, also had hypertensive episodes especially in the setting of agitation. Agitation was addressed with IV sedatives in the early interval of the hospitalization and antipsychotics as detailed below in the latter interval. Hypertensive medications were started and titrated to address the hypertensive spikes - metoprolol and enalaprilat - in conjunction with prn labetalol and hydralazine. Once the hypertensive episodes were less frequent and lower in amplitude (peaking into the 190s at times), the patient was transitioned onto a metoprolol 75 TID and enalaprilat was discontinued. Metoprolol was discontinued ___ because it was suspected as a cause of his eosinophilia. # Sinus Tachycardia: Rate controlled with metoprolol as described above, which was then discontinued because it was suspected to be causing his eosinophilia. Metoprolol was discontinued and Diltiazem was started then titrated to 120 mg PO\/NG QID. # DM2 \/ Hyperglycemia: Blood sugars were controlled with an ISS and when running, TPN insulin to keep BS <150. Patient was started on a low dose of Glargine after TPN was dc'ed as blood sugars ran above 200 with the tube feeds. Glargine was titrated up to 45 U QHS prior to discharge. # Agitation\/Delirium: Once sedation was weaned, the patient had intermittent episodes of agitation and delerium, which were treated with zyprexa 5 qAM & 10mg qPM and prn haldol. This regimen was discontinued late in the hospitalization because it was thought to not be helping the patient's underlying problem, which was insomnia. Prior to discharge he was started on prn 50mg Trazodone QHS, which was effective in inducing and maintaining sleep. # Anemia of chronic disease: Iron studies were suggestive of ACD; patient was transfused as needed to maintain Hct > 22. # Rash: Developed a diffuse macular rash over the extremities with few weapy bullae at the peak of volume overload; dermatology was consulted and ruled out infectious processes; rash progressively improved with diuresis. # ___ \/ Hypernatremia due to low ECV: Normalized with IVF resuscitation. # Coagulopathy on admission due to malnutrition: Resolved with vitamin K; coag labs remained stable over the course of the hospitalization without signs suggestive of DIC. # Difficult Foley Change \/ Yeast UTI: One UC positive with yeast with a corresponding bland UA. He has a history of difficult foley changes and during the hospitalization, foley exchange was deferred despite the positive culture in the setting of diffuse anasarca and benefit of foley to daily aggressive diuresis. Foley was successfully changed ___ and subsequent UA showed 68 WBC with few bacteria and few yeast; he was asymptomatic. Foley was subsequently discontinued; he was spontaneously voiding upon discharge. Anti-fungals were not started under the premise that he would likely clear the infection spontaneously. # s\/p NSTEMI on admission with dynamic EKG changes likely due to demand ischemia. Maintained on ASA 300mg PR daily. # Diarrhea on admission: C.Dif negative x 2. # Eosinopilia: Had eosinophilia to 12% on ___. Was initially thought to be due to Cefepime, which he was desensitized to, as well as Lasix; however, eosinophilia persisted after discontinuing these medications. Metoprolol was discontinued because it was thought to be a potential cause and eosinophilia subsequently started to downtrend. It was thought that Metoprolol was the allergen and that Lasix was not. Eosinophilia persisted despite discontinuing Metoprolol; the cause remains unclear upon discharge.","summary":"You were hospitalized for necrotizing pancreatitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure.

The patient's presentation on physical exam was consistent with a superficial thrombophlebitis vs. early infection at ___ site. She had no fevers and no apparent discharge at site. Blood cultures were negative. Ultrasound of right upper extremity showed no abscesses and no evidence of any DVTs. The right PICC line was removed and a peripheral IV was placed in order to continue her scheduled continuous infusion of Cladribine therapy for her HCL. She was given some local warm packs, and percocet and then Tylenol for pain relief which she tolerated well. She had marked improvement by hospital day 2 with less erythema, less tenderness and less edema at her prior right arm ___ site. Given negative screen for infectious causes and unremarkable ultrasound she was daignosed with a phlebitis reaction at ___ site that can be a common side effect of Cladribine. Because she only had about ~50 hours of her therapy left she remained inpatient for ongoing monitoring for an extra day until completing her full scheduled dose (25 mg remaining).

No evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension, and EGD in ___ was unremarkable. Patient underwent EGD on ___ which was unrevealing for source of bleed. She underwent colonscopy which was also negative. Capusle study only revealed small ileal angioectasia but no active bleeding. The patient remained hemodynamically stable without further epsidodes of acute bleeding. H\/H stable at 8.3\/25.4 on discharge. As described, anticoagulation was started in setting of APLS after discussion of risks and benefits. Discharge per GI recs on PPI daily. #History of PE, APLAS: Home warfarin was held given active GI bleed. The patient carries this diagnosis in the medical record and appears to have been diagnosed in the 1990s with unclear criteria. Her family history is notable for a sister with a diagnosis of APLS and strong family history of connective tissue disease. However given concern for anticoagulation in the setting of GI bleed of unclear source with a supratherapeutic INR, hematology was consulted. Repeat anti cardiolipin, anti beta 2 glycoprotein and lupus anticoagulant antibodies were sent. However despite no clear historical data to prove this diagnosis, the patient felt strongly that she would like to remain on anticoagulation. She was started on hep gtt after colonoscopy without evidence of bleeding. In depth discussion was held with the patient regarding risks of anticoagulation in the setting of the GI bleed, as well as the benefits to prevent possible renal TMA and or DVT\/PE from APLS. Ultimately, after this discussion, the patient elected to be discharged on warfarin without a bridge, with plans for close outpatient follow up with hematology and primary care for further management and follow up of APLS. # ESRD s\/p LRRT complicated by CKD, likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy: Cr at baseline on admission (1.5), although likely hypovolemic in setting of GI bleed.

The patient was advised not take lasix but the patient was insistent upon restarting her lasix. In total, the patient received 10 L of fluid in the ___ ED and MICU as well as electrolyte supplementation with significant improvement in electrolytes. Monitoring included EKG that was without U-waves or ischemic changes. She was transferred to the medical floor, where electrolyte supplementation and maintenance IV fluids were continued. At the time of discharge, the patient's electrolytes were all within normal limits except for a slightly low calcium level (8.1). The patient was scheduled for PCP ___ with electrolyte check a week after discharge. # Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension to sBP ___ thought most likely due hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO intake due to dysphagia. She remained without signs of shock, bleeding, or infection. INACTIVE ISSUES: # History bowel obstruction: The patient was monitored and continued to pass both gas and stool during this admission. # HLD: The patient's home simvastatin 20mg was converted to atorvastatin 20mg daily when diltiazem was started, given concern of rhabdomyolysis from simvastatin and diltiazem in combination. # Insomnia: The patient was continued on her home trazadone 50mg without complications. # ___ swelling: The patient takes furosemide at home. Given that this like contributed or preipitated her electrolyte abnormalities, the patient was encouarged to stop furosemide. However, he felt adamant about resuming this. She will need an electrolyte check at her PCP appointment on ___. =========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =========================== MEDICATION CHANGES - Diltiazem 30mg QID was STARTED for esophageal spasms - Atenolol was STOPPED because diltiazem was started - Amlodipine was STOPPED because diltiazem was started - Simvastatin was STOPPEd because it interacts with diltiazem, and atorvastatin was STARTED instead. - If her diltiazem is not helping her symptoms, it would be reasonable to restart her home antihypertensive regimen. - Patient was cautioned to stop the diltiazem if she experiences dizziness or lightheadedness. - The patient was encouraged to STOP her Lasix given concern that it is source of her electrolyte abnormalities, but she was adamant about continuing this medication. She will likely continue despite our strong warning against it. OTHER ISSUES - Patient has a pending Zinc level. Low zinc can also cause many electrolyte disturbances consistent with her picture, so she should be repleted if this level is low and worked up for causes of low zinc (possibly simple low dietary intake given her eating issues). - The patient remained Full Code during this hospitalization","summary":"You were admitted to ___ ___ for difficulty eating solid food, which you report you have had for several years. You were also found to have several electrolyte abnormalities, likely from your lasix. You were administered intravenous fluids and admitted to the medical ICU where your electrolyte abnormalities were further corrected with fluids and supplements. When your electrolyte abnormalities improved, you were transferred to the medical floor. The Gastroenterology team saw you and recommended that you undergo a \"barium swallow\" test that showed mild esophageal dysmotlity and mild reflux. You had a test call a \"video swallow\" that showed very mild narrowing at the upper esophagus that was felt highly unlikely cause of your symptoms. You were also started a medication called diltiazem to treat your esophageal spasms."}

Acute worsening concerning for further compression, however MRI C\/T\/L spine was reassuring for lack of cord impingement. Persistent uncontrolled pain localized to lumbar mid spine. Mr. ___ had been declining PRN pain medication. Discussion with patient to help him better understand current physical state and that it is okay to need pain medications right now. He agreed that would have a better quality of life if we control his pain presently. Patient was seen by ortho ___, MD, who recommended use of TLSO brace with activity. This alleviated a degree of his pain. Patient course was complicated by constipation most likely secondary to both inability to get to bathroom prn as well as pain when defecating limiting effort. In turn constipation contributed to lower back pain. With PRN use of pain medication and support brace his pain was controlled to degree patient willing to tolerate sedentary side effects of opiates. #Febrile Neutropenia: First spiked fevers ___ as high as 102.7. Subsequently developed Neutropenia. Admission ___: 1300; Nadir ANC 510 (___). Unclear etiology. Initiation of Velcade and Dexamethasone scheduled for ___ were held at this time. No obvious precipitating factor. Started on Cefepime for febrile neutropenia. Results of recent marrow tap not finalized, however per conversation with primary oncology team some samples showing range of 40-90% plasma cell predominance. Patient w\/MM puts at risk for infection given functional hypogammaglobulinemia. Bone marrow crowding is possible, however is now s\/p two doses of bortezomib which usually has a more rapid marrow response. Possible other etiologies include viral etiology such as CMV and EBV as patient has concordant transaminitis. No other known recent sick contacts prior to hospitalization. Did not at present have any localizing symptoms. TLS not common in MM. CXR at time of fever w\/o evidence of consolidation however cannot rule out pneumonia and not aspiration risk or concern for pneumonitis. No abdominal pain or diarrhea suggestive of noro or c diff.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============ #Odynophagia\/Dysphagia: Most likely radiation esophagitis, reflux esophagitis. ___ EGD with esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis. Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given viscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a regular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care with both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative care team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not pursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary symptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to strictures and radiation esophagitis. #Failure to thrive Seems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be due to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). She has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e\/o pulmonary infection. UA neg at OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved in the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body pain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous lidocaine to help her eat\/drink more comfortably. She was supported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and recommended rehab placement however after long discussions of her GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding and would like to go home on hospice. #Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ In the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. HAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for major bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The definitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment of her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA\/Plavix were continued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, with the plan to treat for 1 month. #Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma #Bilateral lytic scapular lesions Most recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial decrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now measures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed \"new 1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for metastasis.\" ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver involvement.

Her outpatient oncology team (Drs ___ was contacted with updates. Hip\/femur x-rays were obtained to eval for osseous\/lytic lesions (because of delays with scheduling a bone scan). #Encephalopathy She's been having episodes of confusion for some time now per daughter. She locked herself in the bathroom last week. \"Thetiles have me locked in the bathroom and I can't get out.\" But the bathroom was not locked. A few weeks ago, she had left the stove on during a hot day, and she stated she was heating food for her son (who was murdered ___. Daughter is concerned about dementia. MRI brain did not reveal mets or new stroke. although pt is oriented x 3, she seems to have poor insight into reason for admission and her hospitalization. Confusion possibly also due to impaired sleep (sleeps during day, as lives with her son who works nights), dehydration, pain from malignancy. Geriatrics was consulted and assisted with her care. Her nutrition and hydration status were optimized and her pain was controlled with IV morphine. She received high dose thiamine for possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. She received folic acid repletion for severe protein calorie malnutrition. CHRONIC\/RESOLVED ISSUES: ======================== #Worsening LUE and LLE weakness - stable #History of CVA w\/ residual hemiparesis Likely recrudescence from prior CVA and improved w\/ hydration and nutrition. Her home aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin were continued. Her neurologic status was checked daily. She was started on Lovenox ___aily. #Severe protein calorie malnutrition: - Nutrition was consulted. She received a regular diet, high dose thiamine, folic acid and MVI. Her electrolytes were monitored daily and repleted as needed. #Tobacco Abuse: Continued nicotine patch. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] Due to esophageal spasms seen during EGD, outpatient esophageal mannometry should be considered to further work up her dysphagia\/odynophagia. [] Consider starting a bisphosphonate, if osseous metastases are confirmed through bone scan\/bone biopsy. Code status: DNR\/DNI EMERGENCY CONTACT HCP: ___ (daughter) ___ This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached medication list for details).

You were not getting enough to eat and drink. Because of this, you were weaker than usual, which made your old stroke symptoms seem worse. Your children were concerned that you were more confused than usual. You received scans to make sure that you did not have a new stroke. You were watched closely for signs of infection. You were supported with fluids and nutritious food. You underwent an endoscopy procedure, which showed a lot of inflammation that is probably causing your swallowing pain. You were given liquid lidocaine for throat pain, as well as an acid blocker medicine. Your body pain was treated with morphine."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ y\/o F with a h\/o ___ esophagus, chronic dysphagia and nausea, anemia, COPD, and Takotsubo's (___), who presents for evaluation of presyncope. ACTIVE ISSUES ============= # Presyncope: BP upon arrival was 97\/67 with tachycardia consistently over 100. Patient has a history of similar symptoms and has presented to ___ several times and treated with IV fluids. Given chronic nausea\/dysphagia, presyncope was attributed to orthostasis in the setting of poor PO intake. Patient had two EKGs during admission, which showed no evidence of ischemia or arrythmia that would explain her symptoms. She received a total of 3.5L NS IVF during her stay with improvement in her SBPs to 110-130's with HR 90's on day of discharge. She also had normal orthostatic vital signs and was able to ambulate without any residual dizziness. Nutrition was consulted given patient's history of poor PO intake and recommended continuing to encourage PO and supplementing with a multivitamin w\/ minerals. # Nausea, Dysphagia, ___: She has a history of chronic nausea and dysphagia for the last several years and has undergone an extensive workup as an outpatient. EGD in ___ confirmed ___ esophagus. She also has had barium swallow, esophageal manometry, gastric emptying studies in ___ without significant positive results. It is likely that anxiety may also be contributing to symptoms, particularly her anticipatory nausea, including nausea upon smelling foods. She had a recent CT abdomen, which showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm with insinuation of the colonic hepatic flexure between the liver and hemidiaphragm (Chilaiditi sign). Based on these results, she was evaluated by the Bariatric Surgery team while inpatient, Per surgery, although eventually a Diagnostic Laparoscopy to look for an adhesion\/kink could be considered, they would first recommend colonoscopy and upper endoscopy. Due to the timing and chronicity of her symptoms, these would best be pursued as an outpatient. She remained nauseous throughout her admission and was given IV Zofran ___ PRN, with PO Ativan 0.25mg once for nausea unresponsive to Zofran. She was also continued on her home omeprazole. She was discharged on PO Zofran for her continued nausea. # SIADH: Patient had Na 131 on admission, which downtrended to 128 day prior to discharge. Urine electrolytes were sent and were notable for urine osm 404 and urine Na 167. High urine osm in the setting of low sodium avidity was attributed to SIADH. Per chart review, patient does have history of SIADH. Based on these results, her worsening hyponatremia was attributed to IV fluid boluses for poor PO intake. # UTI: She has a history of recent UTI with pansensitive E Coli. A UA on admission was notable for pyuria though urine culture was negative. She was given one dose of cefpodoxime in the ED. Upon admission she was continued on her previously prescribed Macrobid dose and completed the last 3 days of her scheduled course during her stay. On day of discharge, she continued to complain of a \"heavy feeling\" with urination though was otherwise asymptomatic. CHRONIC ISSUES ============== # Normocytic anemia: Patient's Hgb as low as 8's during her stay, most likely due to dilutional effect of IVF boluses. Anemia could potentially have further contributed to her symptoms of dizziness\/lightheadedness. The etiology of her chronic anemia is unclear, though past workup has suggested mixed iron deficiency\/anemia of chronic disease. Ferritin was checked during her stay, which was normal and would be consistent with a mixed cause of anemia. She should get a colonoscopy as an outpatient based on possible iron deficiency and length of time since last colonoscopy in ___. # Constipation: She has a history of chronic constipation with BMs q2-3 days at home. Constipation is most likely due to medications (oxycodone, oxybutynin, zofran) and poor PO intake. She was continued on her home colace and started on senna, miralax, and milk of magnesia with improvement. # Bladder Spasm: She was continued on her home dose of oxybutynin. # COPD: She is a former smoker and has a history of COPD with home oxygen requirement of 2 liters. She takes Anoro as an outpatient. She is seen by Dr. ___ at ___. Last PFT's notable for DLCO 39%. She was given 2L O2 via nasal canula during her stay. Anoro was held while inpatient because it is non-formulary, and albuterol nebs were ordered as needed but not required. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - Per surgery, would first recommend EGD and Colonoscopy to further work-up her nausea prior to other interventions, but could consider a Diagnostic Laparoscopy in the long term. She has also had a previous gastric emptying study which was read as fast transit. She has seen an gastroenterologist in the past but would prefer to be referred to a new one. - Nutrition: A multivitamin w\/ minerals was added this admission. Recommend to trend weights at home 3 times per week, and to eat small and frequent meals. - She takes Lasix as needed for leg swelling, this was held during this admission due to low BP and dehydration on admission.","summary":"You were admitted to our hospital after feeling dizzy and having a low blood pressure. This happened because you were dehydrated, likely due to not being able to take enough food by mouth. You were given fluids in your IV, which helped your blood pressure return to normal. You have been having problems with nausea for a long time. While you were here, the surgery team saw you and looked at your CT scan. They do not think that there is any surgery that should be done right now to fix your nausea, but that it will be very important to get a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy done as an outpatient to complete the workup for your nausea. You have had low sodium levels for a long time as well. This is because of something called SIADH, or Syndrome of Antidiuretic Hormone, that causes you to retain extra water and lose fluid."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ M w\/ PMH significant for MGUS, CKD, DM, HTN, and gout, initially presented with left lower extremity swelling and pain thought to be gout, found to have MSSA bacteremia and septic arthritis, fungemia (C albicans) and s\/p I&D and wash out of left foot, epidural abscess evacuation, and C5-T1 laminectomy. . # Bacteremia (MSSA) The patient reported have nightsweats at home and spiked a fever to ___ the evening of admission. Subsequently, the patient was found to have positive blood cultures growing MSSA. He was initially start on vancomycin, which was then transitioned to daptomycin given his changing renal function. He underwent a TTE, followed by a TEE which were both negative for endocarditis. His last positive bacterial blood culture was from ___. He is to have weekly safety labs including CK while he is receiving daptomycin. Given his osteomyelitis and epidural abscess (see below) he is to remain on daptomycin for 6 weeks following his last foot wash out (___). Daptomycin 760 mg IV Q48H x6 weeks ___ to finish on ___ unless otherwise specified by outpatient Infectious Disease follow up. . # Fungemia (C albicans) The patient was noted to be growing ___ albicans from a blood culture dated ___.

He was transitioned to fluconazole po, which he is to take for a total of a 2 week course starting from the date of his first negative blood culture; completing on ___. # C7 Epidural abscess In the evening of ___, patient reported that his LUE felt weak. On exam, he was noted to have significant weakness with extension of his LUE, including triceps, wrist and fingers. An MR of the Cspine was concerning for an epidural abscess at C7. He was taken to the OR on ___ for C5-T1 laminectomy and epidural abscess drainage and he tolerated the procedure well. The abscess fluid that was drained also grew MSSA. His anticoagulation was transiently held (48 hours) while the surgical drain was in place. The drain was d\/c without incident. The patient denied subsequent neck pain and his LUE weakness slowly began to improve. He continues to have difficulties with left finger (digit ___ extension and weakness particuarly with tricep extension. Flexion of the LUE and grip strength remain relatively preserved. Orthopedics will follow up patient as an outpatient though appointments have not been scheduled yet. Orthopedics contacted morning of discharge and will schedule an outpatient appointment. . # Osteomyelitis After the patient's bedside aspiration by podatry, he was taken to the OR for an I&D and bone biopsy. The patient's bone biopsy began growing MSSA as well and the pathology was consistent with acute osteomyelitis. The patient went for subsequent wash out of the wound, and cultures continued to grow MSSA. As above, he is to continue on daptomycin for at least six weeks following his last foot wash out, last dose is to be ___ unless otherwise directed. He is to remain non-weight bearing on his left lower extremity until follow up appointment by podiatry.

No microorganisms were noted on gram stain and the initial fluid culture was negative. The patient underwent a subsequent aspiration of a fluid collection on the lateral aspect of his left foot by podiatry, which revealed MSSA in additional to multiple monosodium urate crystals. He had been started on prednisone by his PCP even prior to admission. This was continued as an inpatient and tapered down given his concurrent infection and as his pain improved. His last dose of prednisone is to be ___. He was not started on uric acid lowering therapy during this admission as he was in an acute flair of his gout. He is to follow up with rheumatology in 4 weeks. # Anemia: Chronically anemic likely related to anemia of chronic disease and chronic kidney disease causing poor EPO production. On day of discharge his Hct level was 22.5. There was no active sources of bleeding or hemolysis and his hct should be monitored while he is in an ___ facility to monitor for stability of Hct. He did not require transfusion during this admission. # Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage 4 The underlying etiology of his CKD was felt to be secondary to his DM. His kidney function was carefully monitored and all medications were renally dosed. He was monitored with the assistance of the nephrology team in order to preserve his current kidney function. Regardless, the patient should follow up with his outpatient nephrologist for follow up when his is discharged. # Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance The patient's initial compliants of unintentional weight loss associated with night sweats and subjective fevers was concerning for malignancy. A repeat SPEP was sent and as per report from his primary oncologist, was consistent with prior. # Insulin dependant diabetes mellitus The patients blood sugars were carefully monitored given the concern for early Charcot joint and changing doses of prednisone therapy. His insulin therapy was down titrated when he had an episode of am hypoglycemia. The patient reported feeling well at the time, but did experience some dizziness. With downtitration of Prednisone dosing the patient required less insulin. Lantus was discontinued and his blood sugars were controlled with Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale. He should remain on HISS while at ___. If his blood sugars remain uncontrolled then he should be restarted on Lantus based on the daily requirement of Humalog. # Hypertension The patient's home antihypertensives were initially held given his bacteremia and the concern that his infection may worsen. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital stay. As his clinic status improved, his antihypertensives were restarted. Although toresemide has been discontinued and he was given metoprolol in place of his atenolol given his CKD. His hypertension remains not at goal <130\/80 but were not titrated further. Would defer to outpatient Nephrologist regarding next steps in management of his hypertension. . # Right elevated hemidiaphragm: Noted in his prior medical chart, dating back to at least ___. The etiology is not entirely clear although it was felt to be stable and there were no interventions during this hospitalization. . # Transaminitis: Elevated but stable without rise in T.Bili or INR.

He received a total of 4 units of pRBCs (2 on ___ and 2 on ___ with stable hematocrit and no further episodes of melena. He was treated with a Protonix drip, transitioned to IV bid. The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS at OSH and high O2 requirement). Ultimately, the patient and his HCP decided against an endoscopy with or without intubation. Plavix and aspirin were held given bleeding, and GI felt that he would be at high risk for rebleed with Plavix given no definitive intervention was done. His need for Plavix was discussed with his PCP, and he was determined to no longer need this medication. He was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge and transitioned to twice daily oral PPI. He will be on this medication for two months and then can transition to once daily.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Patient arrived on the floor with two episodes of chest pain. EKG showed no significant ST or T wave changes during these episodes or at any other point, however, the pain was relieved with SL nitro.

Given the patient's worsening chest pain possibly c\/w angina along with her multiple strong risk factors with a TIMI score of ___, the patient underwent a diagnostic catheterization (with pre-cath hydration with mucomyst\/bicarb to protect her transplanted kidney). The catheterization revealed 1 vessel CAD with diffuse disease of the distal LAD and a D1 lesion of 80%, which was revascularized with balloon angioplasty but not stented. Because there was some difficulty engaging the catheter into the vessel above the inguinal ligament and because the patient was on heparin, there was concern for a retroperitoneal bleed. A CT scan was ordered which was negative for a retroperitoneal bleed and her Hct remained stable. The patient's INR was subtherapeutic because the coumadin was stopped due to the catheterization.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with medical history of COPD, ___ and recently hospitalization for hypoxia, rash and hypereosinophilia who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, worsening skin rash and Hypereosinophilia. #Eosinophilia: On presentation she was noted to have WBC 20.9, with substantial hypereosinophilia (Eos 51 % and absolute eos 10.66). She previously had an extensive work up for the cause of her eosinophilia (infectious, hematalogic, oncologic, rheumatologic, allergic) which was largely negative except for a positive strongyloides for which she was treated with Ivermectin (prior to this admission) without resolution of her symptoms. This was ultimately thought to be a false-positive result based on the fact that she actually had no exposure history. She was noted to have eosinophilic lung and skin infiltrates as well as T-cell polyclonal predominance on BM. Tumor lysis labs (K, LDH, Uric acid, transaminases) and a peripheral smear were sent (___) for concern for acute malignant transformation leading to the profound eosinophilia but were not consistent with an acute transformation. She was followed by several teams including heme\/onc, pulm, derm and cards. It was felt that her hypereosinophilia was likely due to a secondary lymphocytic-predominant hypereosinophilic syndrome for which the treatment is steriods. She was started on prednisone 40mg with rapid steady drop in WBC and %eos (___). The prednisone was increased to 60mg (___) when the %eos was noted to have plateaued at ~10% on 40mg. She was discharged on Prednisone 60mg with the plan to taper after %eos <5% in the outpatient setting. She was discharged with close allergy and pulmonology follow-up. # Shortness of breath: On presentation to the ED she was afebrile and satting 89% RA. Labs were notable for a WBC 20.9 with 50% eos (absolute eos 10.66)BNP 14000. She was also noted to have crackles and wheezing on exam. Pulmonary edema was noted on chest X-ray. He SOB was thus thought to likely be due to her COPD as well as an acute dCHF exacerbation. She received nebulizers and IV diuresis (lasix) with minimal improvement in her SOB. TTE to evaluate cardiac function showed LVEF >75% as well as new LVOT obstruction, thought to contribute minimally to her symptoms. Given her history of markedly elevated Eosinophil count and extensive work up (as above), eosinophilia-driven dyspnea was considered. She had a lung biopsy on a previous admission which showed eosinophilic infiltrate but no evidence of granulomas. She was also noted to be ANCA negative. Cardiac MRI showed no evidence of eosinophilia infiltration or myocarditis. Prednisone (for COPD) was initially held for fear of worsening her respiratory status in the setting of strongyloides, however, given she had been treated for strongyloides and that this diagnosis was much les likely, she was started on prednisone. Continued diuresis and nebulizers did not improve her symptoms substantially. Several teams were consulted including Pulmonology, Dermatology, and Cardiology but the etiology of the respiratory shortness of breath remained unclear. After considerable deliberation, the consensus was that she likely had a lymphocytic-variant of hypereosinophilia syndrome and she was started on prednisone 40mg with significant improvement in her respiratory symptoms along with her COPD meds and gentle diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO QD to maintain an even total body water balance and stable daily weights. The dose of Prednisone was increased to 60mg just prior to discharge due to a plateau as above. She was slowly weaned from 5L of supplemental O2 and discharged on 1L O2. # ___ on CKD: She was noted to have a Cr on 1.5 on presentation from a baseline of 1.1 ___s K of 5.4. It was initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation vs eosinophilia related (malignant proliferation vs direct damage). Tumor lysis labs were mildly elevated but not suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome as the cause of the renal injury. She recieved IV diuresis without improvement. Nephrology was consulted and determined that ___ was most likely due to ___ in the setting of agressive diuresis and exposure to contrast given recent CT with contrast. Urine analysis was bland and not suggestive of eosinophil driven nephropathy. Creatinine returned to baseline with reduction of IV diuresis. Discharge creatinine was 1.3. # Rash: Appearance consistent with a drug rash but extensive allergy testing done prior and lack of new recent exposures made this less likely. Skin lesion biopsied which showed superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils and focal spongiosis, suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction to systemic antigen. thought to be related to hypereosinophilia syndrome. Improved with initiation of oral and topical steriods. Also treated with Cetirizine, low dose Gabapentin, and several anti-histamines. #Hyperkalemia: Noted to have elevated K of 5.4 on admission. Improved as renal function improved as stated above. Noted to be again elevated at 6.3 despite recovered renal function. Unclear etiology but likely dietary. She states that she had been ingesting K rich foods (tomato soups, melons etc). No sign of hemolysis on blood smear or highly metabolis states associated with rapid turnover. Medications not likely contributory. She had an EKG at the time which was normal. Got Lasix 40mg IV and Kayexalate 30mg with recheck that showed K 5. Switched to low K diet after which K downtrended and remained stable for the remainder of stay. # Hypertension: treated with Amlodipine 10 mg and furosemide 40mg PO QD. Permissive hypertension was allowed given new LVOT obstruction. She will be somewhat preload and afterload dependent, and care should be taken not to reduce either of these parameters substantially. # History of Seizures: Continued on home Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin Sodium. levels were checked after starting Prednisone to ensure therapeutic levels. # Full code ***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES*** - Will need a repeat IgE, spirometry and lung volumes to assess response to treatment in the outpatient setting once steroid taper commences. - Was found to have new LVOT with an increased gradient during this admission. Should she develop dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope, consider worsening LVOT as a possible etiology. Avoid over diuresis as well as aggressive preload\/afterload reduction. - hyperkalemia: resolved with low K diet. She should continue with a low K diet. - discharged on Prednisone 60mg PO daily, will need taper - discharge weight: 98.6 kg, Discharge diuretic regimen: Lasix 40mg PO daily - stable mediastinal lymph nodes noted on imaging: given relative stability over time, it is less likely to be neoplastic, though an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder cannot be completely excluded and these should be followed in the outpatient setting.","summary":"You were admitted because of your shortness of breath, worsening rash and because you had a very high level of a specific type of blood cell, called an Eosinophil. We initially treated your COPD and heart failure with medications but those did not seem to fully improve your symptoms. Several different specialists were involved in your care, and you had a lot of tests done which did not show a definite cause. We believe that the eosinophils were driving your symptoms and treated you with Prednisone to suppress the eosinophils with good improvement of your symptoms. It does not appear that your symptoms are due to a cancer in the blood (this was ruled out with a biopsy of the bone marrow, the factory that makes blood cells in the body. This was also unlikely to be from infectrion and medication effect."}

It is possible the patient has underlying viral hepatitis, the serologies were sent in the ED. We are reassured by downtrending LFTs. Iron studies were within normal limits making hemochromotosis less likely. The patient felt significant relief with his bowel movement, and therefore it is likely he had a degree of constipation contributing to his presentation. Troponins were negative and EKG was unremarkable making a cardiac etiology unlikely.

Chest x-ray was most consistent with fluid overload rather than pneumonia as was subsequent clinical course. He was started on ciprofloxacin then narrowed to ampicillin for pan-sensitive enterococcus in the urine; he should be continued for a total of 7 day course of antibiosis, which will be completed on ___. # Respiratory distress - due to CHF. Lasix was given with improvement. An echo did not provide an obvious explanation for why he has a 2L O2 requirement at home after his MI, and it may be that pulmonary follow-up would be appropriate to consider his pulmonary hypertension. He was stable on his baseline O2 requirement when discharged to the rehabilitation facility. # Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure An echo was performed - results above. # Subarachanoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages: he was initially monitored in the neurosurgical ICU and blood pressure controlled with IV nicardipine.

This led to direct admission for workup. CT abdomen\/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel obstruction, but showed findings of ileitis, as well as increasing pancreatic mass size and new hepatic lesions all concerning for progression of his cancer. While hospitalized, he developed recurrent symptoms of nausea, vomiting after an initial improvement, and then developed signs and symptoms of frank obstruction likely related to his pancreatic mass or peritoneal carcinomatosis. No further imaging was pursued. An NG tube was placed for decompression and he had significant improved symptoms. He subsequently underwent palliative venting G-tube is a transition to hospice. ACUTE\/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Abdominal pain # Nausea and vomiting, with malignant obstruction, in setting of progressive acinar cell cancer, and large pancreatic mass # Acinar cell pancreatic cancer He has been off sutinib as his other cancers are being managed and his pulm\/hepatic mets have been stable. He is not yet due for restaging imaging. He is due for ___, LV, liposomal irinotecan. His oncologists are Dr ___ ___ Dr ___ seen on ___. CT abdomen\/pelvis showed increased size of pancreatic head mass (from 6.0 to 8.0 cm), numerous metastatic liver lesions (increased in size and number), interval worsening of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and new 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe. He had been having nausea and vomiting likely related to chemo for several weeks, but then developed diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain the night prior to presentation. His symptoms have resolved. He had 2 watery bowel movements after admission. KUB had showed multiple centrally located distended loops of small bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction. He has not had prior bowel obstruction. Since he has only 1 kidney with a Cr of 1.6, initial CT was done without IV contrast. CT abdomen\/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel obstruction, but showed wall thickening of distal and terminal ileum with adjacent fat stranding, compatible with infectious or inflammatory ileitis. Since he was afebrile with improved symptoms, empiric antibiotics were not started. C. difficile was negative as was ecoli. He was initially treated with bowel rest and IV fluids, then diet was advanced. The CT scan also showed increasing size of pancreatic mass, enlarging and new hepatic lesions, new left lung nodule, worsening retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, all concerning for progression of disease. Given this new complication of his pancreatic cancer, family meeting was held on ___, with a decision to pursue hospice care at home given no other therapeutic options. His prognosis was given as weeks. He was transitioned to liquid concentrated morphine for pain, as well as lorazepam for anxiety, and dexamethasone for nausea. Oral medications were given after his PEG was placed, with clear instructions on how to take them. This included dexamethasone, concentrated morphine, and olanzapine.

He had recent ___ with Cr of 2.2 on ___ and 1.8 on admission, likely due to dehydration. Renal function returned to baseline after getting IV fluids then rose after he likely developed recurrent dehydration. As stated above labs were not rechecked after goals of care change. # History of Portal Vein Thrombus: He was continued on home Rivaroxaban 10mg daily, except for initially being held while NPO. This was continued for now, but should be stopped if decided not consistent with comfort going forward. # Severe protein-calorie malnutrition: He has low albumin and reported low oral intake due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which has been ongoing off\/on for weeks, likely due to chemo and his known cancers.

Active issues: #DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS: The patient initially presented to ___ ___ with glucose >600, Anion gap 30. This rapidly improved with administration of IV fluids and insulin gtt. On transfer to ___ ED, her glucose was 297, and anion gap had almost closed at 14. She was transition to subcutaneous insulin with one hour overlap with gtt and maintained on IV fluids until ___, at which point her creatinine returned to baseline and she was taking adequate PO fluids. Her nausea and vomiting had resolved prior to admission to the floor. She was restarted on her home insulin regimen and her FSBGs remained mostly stable in the ___. The trigger for this episode of DKA was most likely the patient's UTI, treatment for this was begun immediately upon admission as below. #ENTEROCOCCAL URINARY TRACT INFECTION: UA on admission showed trace leukocytes, 5WBC, few bacteria. The patient has a history of frequent UTI (likely ___ self-catheterization), although the patient denied dysuria. She was begun immediately on antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.

Prior to discharge, the patient was transitioned from vancomycin to PO nitrofurantoin, on which she is discharged and will finish the remainder of a 10-day course at home. The patient remained afebrile and asymptomatic throughout her admission. #ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: The patient presented with Crt 2.0 (baseline 1.0), most likely secondary to dehydration, with possible contribution from post-renal obstruction (patient had no urine output the day prior to admission). Acute rejection in the setting of missing 3 doses of immunosuppressants is possible, but unlikely in this case with rapid response to intravenous fluid repletion. The patient was maintained on intravenous fluids until her creatinine returned to near baseline (1.2) and remained stable, and she was taking adequate PO fluids. Her creatinine remained at baseline throughout the remainder of her admission. #ESRD S\/P RENAL TRANSPLANT: The patient missed 3 doses of her home tacrolimus and Cellcept due to nausea and vomiting. She was restarted on her immunosuppresant medications upon admission to the hospital and her tacrolimus levels were trended and followed by the renal transplant team.

A renal transplant ultrasound on ___ showed no evidence of obstruction in the graft kidney. The patient's home vitamin D and calcitriol were continued throughout her admission. She will need to have her tacrolimus level checked one week after discharge (___). #SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: On coumadin for antiphospholipid syndrome. She had an elevated INR of 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) on admission likely due to drug-drug interaction between warfarin and ciprofloxacin. Her warfarin was held and INR was trended until it returned to her goal range. It was restarted at 3mg daily on ___ following an INR of 3.5 the previous day. Her INR was 1.1 on discharge, and she was instructed to measure her INR at home daily for the next several days and to communicate the results to her ___ clinic for further titration of coumadin. Lovenox bridge was considered, but the patient reports having been subtherapeutic in the past without any need for bridge. #TYPE I DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient was maintained on her home dose of insulin Glargine (40U QAM and 30U QHS) as well as her home Humalog sliding scale, with stable daytime FSBGs.

She will check her INR at home and communicate results with her ___ clinic as she has been doing. #CAD s\/p MI: Due to an episode of chest pain during vomiting before admission, she was ruled out for MI, with EKG only significant for right axis deviation that was resolving on follow-up EKG. Her troponin was mildly elevated, peaking at 0.07 in the setting of demand ischemia due to tachycardia on admission. She remained asymptomatic and was continued on her home regimen of atorvastatin, metoprolol, and aspirin. #SCLERODERMA: The patient was maintained on her home dose of 7.5mg prednisone daily with good symptom control. #HYPERTENSION: The patient remained normotensive to slightly hypertensive during admission, with systolic blood pressures ranging 120s - 160, with a one-time asymptomatic SBP of 188,. She was continued on her home regimen of amlodidpine and metoprolol. Her home valsartan was held until her Creatinine returned near baseline and was restarted on ___. # GOUT: The patient was continued on her home allopurinol. # PAD: The patient was continued on her home cilostazol 100 mg every other day. # DEPRESSION\/ANXIETY: The patient was continued on her home duloxetine and despiramine for depression and Ativan for anxiety.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: ----------------- #Submassive Pulmonary Embolism: Patient was admitted with diagnosis of PE by CTA chest at outside hospital with intraluminal filling defects in right interlobar artery and segmental branches in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe but no saddle embolus or evidence of dilation of main pulmonary artery or RV strain. He was initially relatively hypotensive with SBP in the 80___ even while in NSR at a rate of 60bpm and off dilt drip. Unclear what provoked his PE as major risk factor is smoking. He notes having a colonoscopy with removal of polyps ___ years ago without colonoscopy follow-up. There is note of a 4mm uncalcified mass in his RML on CTA chest but unclear what the significance is. Stool guiaiac negative. He was managed on a heparin drip initially and started on coumadin 5mg PO daily. He was discharged home with 5 days worth of lovenox for bridging. He will may benefit from an outpatient evaluation for unprovoked PE includig repeat colonoscopy, serial CT chest to eval progression of mass, and perhaps hypercoagubility workup. He will need, at a minimum, 3 months of anticoagulation with coumadin for which he needs INR follow-up from his PCP to be arranged. #Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: CHADS 1 due to DM2. He initially presented in RVR to a rate of 140's at OSH and was transferred on a diltiazem drip. He rec'd 5mg IV metoprolol with conversion into NSR. This is apparently his ___ known episode of afib and he will need at least 3 months of coumadin for his PE but otherwise aspirin 325mg is probably good enough protection for stroke prevention. We believe his RVR was probably provoked by his PE\/bronchitis. His TSH was wnl's. He may benefit from outpatient echo to assess for structural disease. He was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily for rate control. CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: ------------------ #DM2 Non-Insulin Dependent: A1c 10.6. On metformin as an outpatient.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ================== # Right trochanteric bursitis # Right anterior lower leg pain # Right sided varicose veins Pt endorsed >4mths of pain in RLE that became acutely worse over the last few wks. Her initial exam was most consistent with severe trochanteric bursitis on the right. She also has some focal pain along the right tibia which she felt was most consistent with pain from her varicose veins. The XRs of her tibia\/fibula and right hip were without obvious pathology. There are no concerning neurologic symptoms to suggest a radiculopathy, no weakness or numbness though she may have some degree of chronic sciatica. Mildly decreased patellar reflex on the right as compared to left may have been in the setting of pain and guarding; strength was normal bilaterally as was her sensation. She underwent U\/S guided steroid injection of her trochanteric bursa w\/ significant improvement in symptoms; ___ stated that there was some fluid near the bursa, suggestive of acute on chronic trochanteric bursitis. Her anterior shin pain improved with initiation of gabapentin and lidocaine patch in addition to her home tylenol and an increase in the frequency of her home tramadol (q8h PRN to q4h PRN). Pt was not given her home hydromorphone PRN, though she did require one dose of 0.5 mg IV hydromorphone following her injection in the setting of an acute pain episode.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with longstanding COPD on home O2, ___, atrial fibrillation, admission for PNA\/dyspnea now s\/p chest tube placement (then removal) for questionable empyema who continues to recuperate on IV antibiotics without any additional thoracic procedures. Please see below for more detailed hospitalization summary: . #Shortness of breath \/effusions, healthcare associated PNA: Mr. ___ has longstanding COPD at baseline and requires home O2 2.5L nasal cannula. He arrived to OSH with notable dyspnea worse from typical baseline. This was initially attributed to possible diastolic CHF exacerbation in setting of poorly controlled atrial fibrillation. He was given generous amounts of IV lasix at ___ but continued to have some worse shortness of breath. CXR showed bilateral effusions. However, review of older images shows these are chronic, fairly stable effusions and seem a less likely cause for acute worsened dyspnea. Given elevated WBC to peak 22k, recent malaise, poor PO intake and shortness of breath there was clinical suspicion for underlying PNA with worse local inflammatory\/irritation and COPD flare up as patient with very poor pulmonary reserve. The differential also includes possible underlying malignancy given his declining state x months, prominent smoking history and and note of pleural thickening on recent CT chest. In terms of CHF, recent BNP in 1000s range, h\/o mainly diastolic CHF with EF 55% on TTE just days ago. After concern for possible underlying complicated loculated effusion with CT chest questioning empyema, patient underwent right sided chest tube placement at outside hospital but no pleural fluid able to be collected. He was then transferred to ___ ICU service with urgent thoracic surgery consult. Thoracic surgery team felt patient had very minimal effusions on imaging and did not feel CT chest imaging constituted a true empyema picture. Thus, thoracic surgery felt a repeat attempt at thoracentesis or any other invasive procedures like ___ guided pigtail drain placement or VATS\/decortication would only be of minimal or no benefit given very small amount of pleural fluid which was felt to be chronic as patient has had similar fluid at lung bases in previous imaging. Chest tube was removed in SICU and patient transferred to medical service where he was continued on plan for 8 days continued broad coverage for hospital acquired PNA with IV Vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood cultures with no growth. Also continued patient on PRN nebulizers, Advair inhaler, Spiriva, chest physical therapy routine and he was eventually weaned down to usual home 2L O2 nasal cannula. At time of discharge he had no fevers, WBCs in normal range, and no complaints of cough or shortness of breath. . #Leukocytosis: Trend with initial rise from ___ admission and then resolved after ___ days of being on IV Vancomycin\/Zosyn therapy. WBC trend 10-> 22-> 19-->10--> 8 prior to discharge. Remained afebrile after his transfer to medicine service on ___. Most probable source was underlying PNA. Although there was some initial concern for UTI as his urine grew out coag negative staphylococcus ___ only) at OSH. However, a repeat urinalysis and urine culture collected ___ showed no significant evidence for any UTI. Moreover, patient had no complaints of dysuria, urgency, or frequency. He had some mild tenderness over his abdominal midline and left side but he stated this was chronic and due to history of ventral hernia. He had no concerning abdominal cramps, nausea or emesis prior to discharge. He did have a few loose stools which were felt to be a side effect of his antibiotics. As above, plan is to continue broad IV Abx with Zosyn\/Vancomycin for HAP up until ___ for full 8 day course. . #Right ___ DVT: Mild edema was noted on the right lower extremity. Imaging with ultrasound demonstrated a mixed picture of possible mixture of both some newer\/older thrombi. Patient very immobile at baseline which increases his risk. He was started on weight based IV heparin gtt with close PTT monitoring and started on daily oral Coumadin with plan for at least 3 months of therapy. His heparin was stopped on ___ when his INR rose to 2.3 (on 4mg of coumadin) on the evening of ___ he got 2mg of coumadin. His INR the morning of discharge was 5.1 (goal INR ___ and his coumadin is being held. His INR should be followed daily and coumadin restarted at 1 mg once his INR is <3. He will need 3 months of coumadin treatment for his DVT. He should discuss with his PCP whether he needs to stay on coumadin longer for his A fib. He has no significant GI bleeding in past but he is a slight fall risk at this time which makes longer term anticoagulation decision making more challenging as risks\/benefits need to be discussed further. . #Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled with HRs ___ 100s range. At home had been on PO diltiazem regimen and needed placement on dilt drip, digoxin, and additional metoprolol while at ___. He was transitioned to once daily Toprol XL 150 mg the morning of discharge. ******He did have one episode of emesis and a single dose of metoprolol tartrate 25mg was given as it is unclear whether he vomited his AM XL dose.********* His metoprolol dose will likely need to be further uptitrated for tighter HR control. He had a CHADS score of 3 and a concomitant diagnosis of RLE DVT and is on coumadin (currently with supratherapeutic INR as above). His worsing a fib could have been due to hypovolemia volume shifts vs. infection as outlined above. He was ruled out for acute cardiac syndromes with biomarkers at OSH. Digoxin was stopped early on in his admission and no additional diltiazem was used as he did very well on metoprolol po TID which was transitioned to toprol XL as above . #ARF: Baseline is near 0.9-1.0 range and peaked up to Cr 2.1 range on ___. His creatinine was 0.9 on the day pf discharge. Causes include recent contrast exposure with CT studies, pre-renal causes in setting of OSH lasix dosing. FeUrea <35% and urine electrolyte profile favored pre-renal causes. Renal dysfunction from antibiotics\/AIN was also considered but he only had a very scant amount of eosinophils in urine making this less probable. Vancomycin was renally dosed and troughs monitored. His vanco trough was 34.7 on ___ and 19.8 on ___. His vancomycin dosing was decreased to 1 gram q24 hrs and a dose was given the morning of ___. Gentle IVFs given to patient and his Lasix was held for several days and his creatinine improved back to his baseline. . #Hypertension, benign: Well controlled and normotensive during hospital course. Continued on beta blocker as above with no need to add other agents. His home diltiazem was discontinued. . #COPD, chronic: At baseline on home oxygen at 2.5L by time of discharge. Currently has O2 saturations in the mid ___ range and has no complaints of worse wheeze or shortness of breath. His cough has now resolved. As above, continued home Advair and tiatropium inhaler medications, gave nebulizers PRN, chest physical therapy and treated PNA with broad antibiotics. . #Chronic diastolic CHF: History of noted diastolic CHF.

She has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is contributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand myonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated troponin. # CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, patient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. Her only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs attributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin fell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting of renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to suggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. She was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for evidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to 81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her LDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from simvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues with drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover atorvastatin.

He had been seen ___ clinic earlier that day and labs drawn were significant for a leukocytosis; he was thus sent to the ED for evaluation. ___ the ED initial vitals were: ___ 99%. He spiked a fever to 102.5. Labs were significant for WBC of 17.7 with 90% PMNs, Na of 126, Cr of 2.1, glucose ___ 500s. Lactate 1.4. He was placed on vanc\/cipro\/flagyl. Podiatry performed bedside I&D on ___. Blood cultures grew group B strep, group G strep. These also grew out of wound cultures; MSSA also grew out of the wound. He was taken back to the OR for further I&D on ___ and ___. Surface ECHO was performed and negative for any mass or vegetation. WBC trended down, though did have slight uptrend prior to discharge (14.2 on day of discharge). He was hemodynamically stable throughout his stay. He was discharged on ertapenem 1g q24hrs at home, to be taken for another 6-weeks, with stop date of ___. # Type 2 diabetes: uncontrolled, last HbA1c was 13.6 (___). Patient was placed on his home medication which was Lantus 40units qAM. Initially his FSBGs were high, requiring large amounts of sliding scale correction at mealtimes. However as his infection was controlled, his FSBGs were less that 200. Given that not much adjustment was made to his insulin from home, yet his sugars were much better controlled than his HbA1c suggested, it was thought that his dietary discretion at home may be playing a significant role. He was seen by nutrition for diet education. He will follow-up with his PCP for further titration of his insulin regimen. Given drug interaction, his preadmission simvastain was stopped and he was placed on atorvastatin 20mg daily. He was continued on his ASA 81mg daily. # Acute on chronic kidney injury - Cr on admission up to 2.1 from baseline ~1.4-1.6. Likely due to hypovolemia from sepsis as has improved with IVFs and ABx. At discharge his Cr was 1.7. # HTN: Prior to admission the patient was maintained on atenolol and lisinopril. His antihypertensives were intitially held due to severe infection. He was eventually placed back on lisinopril and uptitrated to 10mg daily. Additionally he was started on amlodipine 5mg daily. His atenolol was held given his CKD. His BPs were maintained at SBP 120-130s on this regimen. # Anemia: Review of records show baseline Hbg of around 10.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ year old gentleman with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congested heart failure, and multiple other problems transferred from ___ ___ for choledocholithiasis, hypotension and acute renal failure, had a brief stay at the ICU before transferred to the general medicine unit. While at the ICU, Mr. ___ was started on Flagyl 500 mg IV Q8H and Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO Q24H for 24 hours. He was given a total of 4500cc IV fluid during his ED and ICU stay. The ICU team decided to postpone on Mr. ___ ERCP until ___ because he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable without leukocytosis. On ___, patient was seen by hematology\/oncology consultants who performed bone marrow biopsy to work up his acute on chronic anemia. Given chronic elevated MCV in the setting of normal folate and B12, differentials then include alcohol, myelodysplastic syndrome, liver disease, reticulocytosis, or medications such as anti-metabolites. In Mr. ___ case, the first two causes were highest on the differential. Over the course of his stay, Mr. ___ hematocrit stayed around 25 (from a baseline of 31). He subsequently received two units of red blood cell transfusion, one in the evening of ___, and one in the early morning of ___, with subsequent hematocrit at 31. On ___, Mr. ___ underwent ERCP for extraction of his common bile duct stone. The procedure had no complication. Sphinterotomy was performed, and a single 15mm filling defect consistent with a calcified round stone that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the lower ___ile duct. There was post-obstructive dilation. The stone was not able to be extrated at the time because of its size and calcification. A 10 ___ 7cm stent was placed to enable drainage of the bile. Patient was told to return for a repeat ERCP in six weeks (___) for re-evaluation. A routine EKG done after ERCP showed diffuse T wave inversion with asymmetrical T waves. CK levels over the next ___ hours remained around 25, and Troponin T was 0.1->0.1->0.07. Patient was asymptomatic throughout the episode. No pre-ERCP EKG was available for comparison, and cardiology consult felt that these changes were unlikely ischemic because the non-territorial nature of T wave inversion, and that similar inversions were noted in selected lead II in telemetry from ___. It is possible that the patient had a demand ischemic event in recent past, but in the setting of recent acute kidney injury and anemia, had a mild elevation of cardiac enzymes that persisted. He was started on aspirin, metoprolol, and statin. Heparin was not initiated because of the lack of symptoms, unclear timing and onset for the elevated troponin, and the past history of upper GI bleed. Echocardiography on ___ (one day after the EKG change) showed ejection fraction of 30%, a reduction from 40% in ___. It also showed diffusely depressed left ventricular wall motion. His primary care physician, ___, was informed of these findings, and a stress test had been scheduled within a week of discharge at ___ with his cardiologist, Dr. ___. He will continue to take aspirin, statin, lisinopril and beta blocker (his heart rate was 75 with metoprolol). Given that he had not previously been on statin, his liver function test should be checked on an outpatient basis, and this had been communicated to his primary care physician. Mr. ___ also had acute kidney injury when he initially presented to us. FeNA was borderline (1.9%) but of uncertain value because patient was receiving IV bolus of lasix prior to transfer at OSH. This acute on chronic renal failure was likely secondary to hypoperfusion of the kidney, as the patient's blood pressure was in the ___ prior to transfer. His creatinine gradually improved throughout his stay here, coming down from 3.1 to 1.8 (with his baseline at 1.4). His urine output was adequate, and renal ultrasound was unremarkable. He was also hyponatremic on presentation, but the level improved after fluid restriction. Mr. ___ also had a history of alcohol abuse, and throughout this hospitalization he was given daily thiamine, multivitamin, and folate. His CT at ___ showed a cirrhotic liver with a hypodense lesion in the left liver lobe, and the team recommended that this be followed up on an outpatient basis, along with education on alcohol cessation. This had also been communicated to the primary care physician.","summary":"You originally presented to ___ on ___ with low blood pressure, acute kidney injury, and were found to have a stone in your common bile duct. You were treated with fluid and antibiotics for presumed abdominal infection, and you were transferred to the ___, first in the intensive care unit, and then here on the general medicine floor. Your kidney function appears to be recovering now, but your anemia is still being worked up. The hematology oncology team here performed a bone marrow biopsy, and the result will be communicated to your primary care physician, and this can be followed up on an outpatient basis. You also underwent esophageal retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to evaluate your common bile duct stone. The stone was calcified, and its large size and integration into the common bile duct wall prevented a safe and swift removal with the ERCP. Consequently, a metal stent of 10 ___ diameter was placed to allow normal bile flow. After ERCP, your routine electrocardiogram showed new changes that were concerning for cardiac ischemia. We therefore underwent a series of blood test to assess whether your heart was sufferring from an acute injury. Over the next ___ hours, your cardiac enzymes, although slightly elevated, did not increase, and we concluded that the elevated level might be secondary to your suboptimal kidney function, rather than as a result of cardiac injury. You also underwent echocardiography as part of this evaluation, and it did not show any new cardiac wall motion abnormality suggesting heart muscle injury from ischemia; nor was there evidence of any acute cardiac event. Lastly, during your stay at the ___, a CT scan of your abdomen showed a cirrhotic appearing liver with a ~1cm hypodense lesion. This needs to be followed up with your primary care physician as an outpatient issue. You will have a repeat ERCP here at ___ in one month to re-evaluate your common bile duct stone and the newly placed stent. Given the change in your cardiac status, we decided to add several medications. You should continue to take metoprolol, aspirin, and atorvastatin. Please speak with your primary care physician as to whether you should continue these medications. If you remain on atorvastatin you will need to have your liver enzymes monitored. In addition, you will need to have a stress test within one week of discharge from the hospital. This may be arranged by your primary care doctor. Your lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were being held because of the decreased kidney function. Your lisinopril was restarted at half your normal dose on the day of discharge."}

ACUTE ISSUES: ==================== # Odynophagia\/Dysphagia #Radiation Esophagitis Managed with oral liquid lidocaine formulation, which improved patient's ability to tolerate PO. Speech and language pathology consutled, recommended soft ground diet and thin liquids, which was advanced to regular solids. Nutrition consulted as well. If symptoms fail to improve with liquid lidocaine and with a time course consistent with radiation esophagitis, will need further workup as outpatient, such as barium swallow or EGD. Patient was started on lansoprazole for any contribution of GERD, should continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient. # Hypernatremia Patient with rising Na this admission, up to 149. Likely poor oral intake iso radiation esophagitis. Patient received 1L D5W with improvement of Na to 141 on day of discharge. She was encouraged to maintain liquids throughout the day. # Severe Malnutrition Patient with poor PO intake and weight loss. Nutrition was consulted, and per their recommendations she received Carnation supplements with soy milk with meals, as well as Ensure Clear with meals and multivitamins. PO intake was encouraged. SW was consulted due to concern about her having adequate resources at home (but she denies having issues with resources). ___ assessed her and recommended home, where she already has a walker.

In terms of her blood pressure, she normalized to her baseline values of around 140-160 during her admission while she was on her home medications. From the perspective of her gait instability, there did not appear to be an acute process. A neurology consult concluded that this was likely not a central process (stroke) and thus referred her for outpatient follow-up. #Gait instability - Ms. ___ endorsed a ringing in her ears, dizziness with movement of her head, and some unsteadiness while walking. With CT imaging that did not show an acute process and with her clinical picture, she is most likely to have a peripheral issue such as vestibular neuritis or labrynthitis.

Failure to thrive was thought largely nutritional in setting of this very poor PO intake. However she is on significant opiate regimen which was thought to contribute as well both from standpoint of GI motility and mental status. Opiates were downtitrated as below with some improvement. # NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Patient with chronic post-prandial nausea\/vomiting. Imaging was remarkable only for biliary dilatation (see below) with no evidence of obstruction or other etiology of nausea\/vomiting. She underwent EGD to evaluate her anastomosis; this was normal. Nausea\/vomiting thought likely multifactorial due in part to high dose opiate use and decreased GI motility, as well as inability to tolerate large volumes of food s\/p Roux en Y.

However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme leak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent cardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, lactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary edema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who transferred the patient to cardiology floor. # Acute systolic CHF exacerbation\/mitral regurgitation: Likely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in worsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior wall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac cath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically with lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was consulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair\/replacement. However, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high risk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made to revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient would regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a bare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in the diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her mitral regurgitation. # NSTEMI\/CAD: As evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was briefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac catheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As the patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to the cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with h\/o CAD s\/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial fibrillation, h\/o cardiac arrest with heart block s\/p AICD\/pacemaker, trach\/PEG, and recent ICU admission with GI bleed, hematuria, and MRSA bacteremia, who presented from rehab with fevers and persistent MRSA bacteremia while on vancomycin. #. MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent bacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood cultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite appropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent seeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both negative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his pacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult focus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity ultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot but was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced at ___ was removed. A new one was not placed until he had negative blood cultures. He was continued on vancomycin and dosing was changed to 1g q48h. Further blood cultures were negative. Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular source but it was not found during this hospitalization. He should be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date of his last positive blood culture, with last day ___. #. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an indwelling foley it was suspected that this might be colonization however his cultures were positive even after changing his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his urine as well as wound culture. It was multidrug resistant pseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day course. He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough < 1. He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his urine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last day ___. #. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his MRSA bacteremia. Other cultures returned positive as above. He also had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with septic arthritis. His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line holiday. He was ruled out for C diff. #. Acute renal failure: BUN\/creatinine elevated to 70\/1.7 on admission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor forward floor from chronic systolic CHF. His creatinine slowly improved with diuresis. #. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical ventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to trach mask for any length of time. This was felt to be related to chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial pulmonary edema. Diuresis was difficult due to his large obligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix 80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid. His metolazone may need to be decreased over the next several days if he is overdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen for the few days prior to discharge. On the day of discharge, he was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the 300's. #. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during this admission. #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his home carvedilol. His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely and was not restarted due to renal failure. He was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his creatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing diuresis. #. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV. He was started on a fentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control. #. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure remained stable during this admission. He is off anticoagulation due to h\/o GI bleeding and hemothorax. He was continued on carvedilol. #. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who recommended the following: 1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid management. Turn q 2 hours. 2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry. 3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft sorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily. 4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and wrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape. 5. No tape on skin. 6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days. 7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to assist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with Mepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days. 8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal tissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to assess with edema. 9. Waffles bilateral feet. 10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily. 11. Support nutrition and hydration. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Monitor I\/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given large doses of lasix and metolazone. ___ need to back off on metalazone if signs of overdiuresis. However, would continue to aim for -500cc daily I\/O balance. - Needs tobramycin trough drawn ___ AM. Give tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0. - Continue vancomycin until ___ for MRSA bacteremia.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Summary: ___ yo male with a history of CAD (2 DES placed into LAD on ___, hyperlipidemia, HTN, and smoking history presenting with left chest tightness. CORONARIES: The patient has known CAD with a cath report from ___ and an intervention with placement of 2 DES into the proximal and distal LAD (lesions were hazy though FFR showed pressure gradient difference). At that time, he only had single vessel disease. The patient presents with a different type of discomfort than his previous anginal pain. Cardiac enzymes x 3 were normal and there were no EKG changes. The patient did not experience any discomfort during the hospitalization. He was continued on Plavix, high dose aspirin, lisinopril and a statin. A beta blocker was held because he had an adverse reaction to it in the past. Since his discomfort was different than his prior and his last cath was only 2 months ago, it was decided to perform a stress echo on the patient. The stress echo was normal revealing excellent physical endurance and a very good functional exercise capacity without ECG of 2D echo evidence of inducible ischemia. On discharge, the patient was given a prescription for sublingual nitroglycerin.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo ___ speaking F with CAD, chronic ear infection who presents with presyncope and fall at home. . # Presyncope: Likely orthostasis in setting of HCTZ use and possible mild dehydration. Hyponatremia may have also contributed. Patient ruled out for MI. Neurological exam had no focal deficits. There was no evidence of infection, however urine cx was pending at discharge. Patient has bradycardia ___ SSS, but this is a chronic issue and patient is asymptomatic with bradycardia on the floor, and responded appropriately to exercise. No events on tele. Patient was not orthostatic after receiving gentle IVF. Physical therapy consult cleared patient for independent ambulation with walker. HCTZ was discontinued. Patient will have her BP monitored off this medication by her PCP, and may require a replacement medication. Amitrityline was another candidate for causing confusion and falls, however patient has noted benefit from this in terms of headaches. If falls continue, could consider stopping Amitrityline as well. . # Hyponatremia: Patient has h\/o hyponatremia in setting of HCTZ, possibly with mild SIADH component as well (since Na did not completely normalize when taken off of HCTZ). Patient had brain MRI as outpatient which showed only moderate microvascular disease, which is unlikely to explain hyponatremia. Patient does have evidence of COPD on CXR, but no other intrathoracic pathology to cause SIADH. Urine osm were intermediate, so no clear SIADH picture. Patient did start taking HCTZ taking on her own over the last few days for leg swelling. This likely accounted for worsened hyponatremia at admission. After holding the HCTZ, giving IVF, and encouraging POs, sodium was in normal range. Patient was instructed not to take HCTZ, and to instead use compression stockings for leg edema. . # Lower extremity edema: This was very consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. Patient describes swelling that only occurs over the course of the day, and improves with rest and elevation. She has not been wearing compression stockings. Otherwise patient had no evidence of volume overload on exam. She is at risk for CHF given CAD and past MI, and should continue to weight herself daily. . # Sick sinus syndrome: Followed by Dr ___ as outpatient. No need for pacemaker given appropriate response to exercise. This episode is highly unlikely to be cardiac in etiology. Sinus bradycardia on tele. Asymptomatic. . # L gluteal pain: No fracture noted on L-spine films. Likely soft tissue trauma from fall. . # Hypercalcemia: Borderline and chronic, with mildly elevated PTH in past. This degree is very unlikely to be causing symptoms. . # Anemia: Hct 28 in baseline range. . # HTN: continue lisinopril. . # Hyperlipidemia: continue statin . #: Headaches: chronic, likely related to chronic ear infections\/mastoiditis. . # Otitis media: Right ear chronically infected.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Medicine Attending Progress Note Time patient seen and examined today HPI on Admission: Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a PMHX of partial aortic dissection, HTN, who presents w\/ HA & fever x2d concerning for meningitis. Patient reports that 3 days ago, he developed malaise and terrible headache: constant, dull, diffuse. The following day, headache was relenting ___ pain. Also had fever of 102 and took tylenol\/ibuprofen without relief of symptoms. He reports nausea and decreased PO intake. Denies vision changes, sensitivity to light, syncope, URI sx, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, diarrhea\/constipation, sick contacts. Has mild neck stiffness as well. He lives in ___, does a lot of yardwork. Has had exposure to ticks, mosquitoes, but none he memorably recalls recently. No recent travel hx. No rash. He was feeling entirely well prior to onset of these symptoms. Given terrible headache and fever, he presented to the ED. Hospital Course to Date: The pt was admitted for acute onset headache and fever. LP showed a cell count of 141 with lymphocytic predominance and elevated protein to 100. He was initially started on bacterial meningitis coverage, then narrowed to acyclovir based on negative CSF stain and cultures. Doxycycline was added to cover potential lyme meningitis. The pt's CSF came back positive for HSV PCR. Per ID recommendations from ___: \"Would recommend continuing on Acyclovir for now but when safe for discharge can change to Valtrex 1 gram po three times per day to complete 14 day course. In setting of only low positive HSV 2 PCR and extensive outdoor activity would also complete 14 day course of doxycycline even though lyme is less likely.\" The pt improved dramatically. His headache resolved. Throughout his hospitalization, he had no confusion or neurologic deficits. He was transitioned to oral acyclovir the day before discharge and discharged on PO acyclovir + PO doxycycline for a total 14 day course. Of note, the pt was incidentally found to have an abnormally low Hb on admission. He required 1u PRBC transfusion ___. He denies any known bleeding. GI was consulted and recommended EGD + colonoscopy, performed ___. EGD showed diffuse erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding noted in the antrum, consistent with gastritis. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential mass of malignant appearance in the distal rectum completely encircling the rectal verge. There were local ulcerations in the 12:00 position. Colorectal surgery was consulted. They recommended follow up at the colorectal cancer clinic. Follow up was arranged prior to discharge and the pt was aware of the diagnosis and need for follow up. The clinic and colorectal surgery asked for a baseline CEA which was normal. They asked for a staging MRI pelvis which did not show any spread of the presumed cancer. Pathology was sent by GI. Initial pathology showed superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma. This was pending at the time of discharge, though initial reports had shown the same diagnosis, so the pt was instructed to follow up with GI. The GI phone number was shared with the patient and he was instructed to call them directly if he did not hear from the clinic within 24 hours. The pt received a total of 2u PRBCs this hospitalization. Hb was 7.2 on the morning of discharge and the pt received 1u PRBCs (the second unit this stay) on the day of discharge after the Hb of 7.2 in order to ensure that his Hb did not drop below 7.0 at home. Close follow up was arranged prior to discharge. The pt had no active bleeding at the time of discharge. Return to ER precautions such as dizziness and increased bleeding were reviewed with the patient. The pt's BP meds were held on admission but restarted prior to discharge.","summary":"You came to the hospital with severe headache and fevers.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a PMH notable for ESRD s\/p LRRT in ___ (on tacro, cyclosporin, and prednisone), T1DM, CREST syndrome, CAD s\/p MI x2 and DES x3 in ___, who presented with confusion, fevers, and headache, as well as nausea\/vomiting. #ENCEPHALOPATHY: She has had several prior presentations for confusion in the past few years without any definitive etiology, previously attributed to Tacrolimus toxicity (at which time she was switched to rapamycin, but switched back to Tacro after developing proteinuria) and hypoglycemia. After these episodes, she returns to her baseline. On this admission, she was evaluated for many causes including infection; iatrogenic etiologies; PRES and vascular dementia. 1) INFECTION: Ruled out for meningitis with an LP (negative for bacterial etiologies as well as HSV, CMV, and other viruses). She received approximately 7 days of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and aclyovir while awaiting study results, and 5 days of bactrim. She also had significant pyuria but no bacteria grew on urine culture; however, 7d of cef\/vanc treated this possible diagnosis. She had no other localizing signs or symptoms of infection. 2) IATROGENIC CAUSES: Though she didn't have characteristic tremors, her tacro was replaced by cyclosporin in case this was toxicity. Several other medication changes were made, detailed under transitional issues below, to minimize those that can cause confusion. 3) POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME (PRES) and 4) VASCULAR DEMENTIA: The patient did initially get better by ___, but on subsequent days was more confused again, particularly about higher-level functioning, such as not remembering how she gives herself insulin with meals. Given some ongoing hypertension (pressures often in the 150s-170s, rarely as high as 180s-190s), and the relapsing-remitting presentation, there was concern for PRES in the setting of immunosuppression. Her initial MRI was of limited utility due to artifact so a repeat MRI was done on ___ which did not show evidence of PRES or lingering encephalitis. However, it did show microangiopathy and microvascular changes that could have progressed from prior scans -- not from most recent scan, however. Course additionally notable for grossly normal electrolytes; EEG with no seizures but intermittent right parietal slowing not correlating to findings on exam or imaging; and normal folate\/B12\/TSH. The patient was clearly improved (close to her \"real\" self, per her sister) at time of discharge, but still lacked some higher-level functioning (not remembering how she doses insulin with meals). It was not clear to us that glucose, blood pressure could explain her course. Unfortunately, we did not come to a satisfying diagnosis for the patient. Given what appears to be a stepwise decline, and her elevated blood pressures, and MRI findings, we are concerned for vascular dementia, but if this were to explain her previous episodes, we would expect her not to regain functioning in-between, and would expect worsening on imaging since ___. It could have been that N\/V lead to an ___ causing transient Tacro toxicity and leading the patient to commit errors in taking her medications, exacerbating confusion, but this is entirely impossible to prove (and she had no ___ on admission). Ultimately, we discussed with the family the need for further outpatient workup and to minimize medications that can contribute to confusion. # HYPERTENSION: Persistent on home medication, generally higher in the morning. Has been <180 except for rare exceptions, but regularly 150-170s. With proteinuruia that developed during admission, likely not attributable to cyclosporin. Unclear if elevated from neuropathic pain or nausea as patient only intermittently endorses these. Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily and ultimately held losartan due to ___. Continued metoprolol. # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY and # PROTEINURIA in the setting of # ESRD s\/p LRRT: Generally maintained UOP >2L\/day. Did develop proteinuria on ___ (noted due periorbital edema), but this downtrended. Of note, patient was switched to cyclosporine on ___ due to concern for Tacro contribution to AMS and had an ___ on ___ attributed to elevated cyclosporin levels, downtrending by discharge. Mycophenolate and prednisone continued. There was initial concern for rejection based on transplant ultrasound, but stable function and output were reassuring. # BRITTLE T1DM: Complicated by nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Insulin adjusted as per discharge medication list. # NEUROPATHY: Chronic problem for patient for which she is on many medications that can contribute to altered mental status. Held all of these, and she was able to tolerate. Discussed utility of adding back slowly and with help of a doctor to ensure she is not more confused on any of them. # ANTICOAGULATION: Patient has a reported history of APLS, but the diagnosis was not clear when Hematology was consulted in ___. Patient prefers to be on anticoagulation per that documentation. Discussed reasoning for being on warfarin with patient and her sister. The 3 concerns the patient had were for pulmonary embolism, stroke and protecting her stents. We talked about the risks of bleed (which she has already had) on warfarn; the role of aspirin in protecting her stents; absence of literature using warfarin as empiric stroke protection in patients without AF (and risk of hemorrhagic conversion if stroke occurred); and the fact that her PE in the 1990s was provoked and only required brief treatment. Though the risk of PE and potentially stroke are higher off of warfarin, her history of massive GI bleed and presence other modifiable risk factors to reduce likelihood of stroke made discontinuing warfarin a reasonable plan. We initially held warfarin in setting of possibility for procedures and her INR was reversed for LP; after discussing with patient we decided to continue to hold warfarin but touch base with outpatient providers. They agreed over email to the discontinuation. # NAUSEA\/VOMITING: Likely gastroparesis. Abdomen exam benign; LFTs and lipase normal. Per patient, had been going on for months (since pre-___). Became much less frequent while inpatient. Of note, family thinks this could be tied to confusion as primary neurologic cause. We discharged her with metoclopramide in addition to ondansetron as PRN antiemetics. # CAD: home aspirin, atorvastatin, ranolazine, metoprolol. Underwent triple angioplasty at ___ for CAD for angina in ___. Atorvastatin dose-reduced to 10mg in setting of cyclosporin, which increases myopathies; it can be increased as patient tolerates, and she was discharged on 20mg. # PVD: Home cilostazol # Hypothyroidism: Home levothyroxine # History of GI Bleed: Home esomeprazole. # CODE: FULL (presumed) # CONTACT: ___ (sister, ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ================== #FOLLOW UP LABS: Please obtain Chem-10, CBC, UA, CK and cyclosporin levels on ___ and fax them to ___, MD, at the ___ Kidney ___ (FAX: ___ #HYPERTENSION: If the patient's blood pressure is consistently >160\/90, please contact Dr. ___ at the Kidney ___ @ ___ MEDICATION CHANGES: ------------------- NEUROPATHY MEDS: Gabapentin, duloxetine and vicodin all held in the setting of altered mental status. The patient reported that her neuropathy was not bothering her significantly during admission. Please consult with transplant team (specifically transplant pharmacology) if patient has escalating neuropathy, as there may be an alternative medicine (such as pregabalin) that could cause less confusion while also not interacting with immunosuppression. #NAUSEA MEDS: Switched ondansetron for promethazine as an antihistamine may contribute more to confusion. Change approved by transplant pharmacy. #ANTIHYPERTENSIVES: -AMLODIPINE increased from 2.5mg BID to 10mg daily -LOSARTAN discontinued due to ___ -METOPROLOL continued #ANTICOAGULATION: As described above, long conversation with patient and sister (HCP ___ resulted in holding Warfarin. She was reversed with Vitamin K for her LP, so last day of therapeutic coverage wasa ___. #ATORVASTATIN: lowered dose from 40mg to 10mg per day because of increased myopathy risk in cyclosporine. She tolerated 10mg for several days and was increased to 20mg on day of discharge. Okay to increase back to 40mg if patient tolerates it without side effects. #RANITIDINE: This was held after confirming with GI Dr. ___ ___. Concerned that large dose could contribute to patient's confusion. #PRAMIPEXOLE: Held in setting ___ and not restarted due to nausea and headaches (presenting complaints) being side effect, and patient having significant restless leg syndrome during inpatient stay. Of note, she was stable and without worsened neuropathy, headache or nausea for several days on this altered regimen prior to discharge. FOLLOW UP ---------- - Patient should see Dr. ___ about possible diagnosis of vascular dementia vs. other etiologies for recurrent\/worsening confusion. - MRI showed \"T1 hyperintense focus of the right thalamus on sagittal T1 sequence without correlate of signal abnormality on other sequences. This is presumably artifactual in nature,\" but CT could be obtained to compare. - Hematology: Per ___ inpatient hematology note, patient should follow up in ___ clinic for possible APLS, though doees not appear from this documentation and concurrent labs that this patient carries this diagnosis. Conversation with patient about anticoagulation documented above. Likely does not need hematology f\/u, but this should be on the radar particularly if the patient has other questions given her history.","summary":"Please see below for information on your stay. You were very confused, and your family was worried about you Many CT scan pictures of your head ruled out stroke or big problems in your brain. A lumbar puncture (LP) was negative for any bacterial infection. Studies sent off for infections caused by viruses were also negative. 7 days of antibiotics were given while waiting for these results. 7 days of antibiotics were given to treat a possible urinary tract infection, though your urine never grew bacteria. Many of the medicines you were on could cause confusion, so we stopped the ones we thought it was safe to stop. Your kidney transplant medicine, Tacrolimus, was switched to another called Cyclosporin. An MRI of the brain ruled out certain reasons for your confusion, but did show evidence of possible tiny strokes. Your blood pressure was very high, so your antihypertensive medicine was adjusted. Your sugars were low at first when you weren't eating, and then were very high, so your insulin was adjusted. We talked about stopping your coumadin\/warfarn because it is a dangerous medicine and you do not have a strong reason to be on it.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ F h\/o DMI diagnosed at age ___ with no prior h\/o DKA, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, HLD, anxiety who presents with nausea, vomiting and hyperglycemia. ACTIVE ISSUES #) Hyperglycemia: Likely DKA given blood sugars elevated to the 300s and h\/o DMI, with evidence of ketonuria. Precipitant unclear; most likely due to malfunctioning pump. Other possible precipitants included infection such as viral gastroenteritis or pneumonia. Initial AG was 24. She was treated with insulin drip and her gap closed. She was transitioned to BID Lantus and Humalog sliding scale insulin. She was seen by ___ who provided recommendations for insulin titration. She was also seen by a diabetes nurse educator who provided recommendations to transition the patient back onto her pump prior to discharge. She was transiently hyperglycemic on the night prior to discharge, as expected given her transition from glargine and humalog injections back onto her pump and received a correction bolus. She is discharged home with ketone strips and will follow up in the ___ clinic 2 days after discharge on ___. #) Leukocytosis: Differential diagnosis included infection versus hemoconcentration. Infection could be viral gastroenteritis based on abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting (though these symptoms could be a manifestation of DKA rather than precipitant). CXR revealed impressive obscuration of right heart border, which may represent aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis in the setting of nausea\/vomiting. She did not have SOB or cough to suggest typical or atypical PNA. She did not have dysuria to suggest UTI. Considered influenza given reported myalgias, generalized weakness and subjective fever, though patients illness began with abrupt onset GI distress making flu less likely. Leukocytosis may be a reflection of hemoconcentration to some extent given elevated albumin and Hgb\/Hct approaching upper range of normal with significant decrease in all cell lines after receiving IVF fluids. She was started on azithro\/CTX for five-day course and then transitioned to azithro monotherapy. CHRONIC ISSUES #) Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine. #) Epilepsy: Continued home lamotrigine. #) HLD: Continued home simvastatin. #) Anxiety: Continued home alprazolam. Continued home fluoxetine. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES * Patient will follow up with ___ on ___ to adjust insulin pump","summary":"As you know, you came to the hospital with nausea and vomiting. You were found to have diabetic ketoacidosis. You received intravenous insulin and your blood work improved. You were transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.

These were thought to be due to a small vessel disease. Her MRA was unrevealing. Her bloodwork revealed elevated lipids, for which she was started on Zetia and omega-3 fatty acids as she indicated that she could not tolerate lipitor in the past because it made her weak. Her HgbA1C was mildly elevated to 6.7, and she was counceled that she may have, at the least, glucose intolerence. She was instructed to modify her diet, be physically active, and follow this up with her PCP. Because she became angry when told of the possibilty of diabetes, these instructions, along with her med changes, were discussed with both her son and daughter. She was also counceled to stop smoking, and to be compliant with her medications.

Patient's troponins were negative X4 and d-dimer also negative which provided reassurance of non-ACS and non-PE event. Recreation of patient's chest pain with palpation of his chest wall was initially thought to be most consistent with a costochondritis. However, EKG obtained upon admission showed diffuse ST elevations consistent with pericarditis and the patient was treated empirically for pericarditis. TTE showed a trivial pericardial effusion and preserved global left ventricular systolic function with a mildly dilated aortic sinus. As the patient was unable to receive NSAIDs due to known CAD and questionable GI bleed on last admission, he was started on colchicine and prednisone. This combination improved his chest pain overall, though he continued to have occasional episodes of midsternal pain leading up to discharge. These episodes were all self-limiting and were not associated with any new EKG changes or troponin elevations. The patient underwent a stress test to ensure no ischemic disease. He had no anginal symptoms or significant STTW changes during the pharmacological stress and myocardial perfusion was normal. The patient will be discharged on colchicine (0.6 mg BID) and a prednisone taper. ___ Patient's creatinine bumped from 1.1 on admission to 2.2 on ___. Patient had been NPO prior to myocardial perfusion study and the etiology of the ___ was thought to be pre-renal. This was supported by urine electrolytes studies which revealed a urine Na < 20 and urine Cl also < 20, consistent with sodium avid state. The patient was treated with a 1.5 liter fluid bolus and his creatinine rapidly downtrended. The patient's creatinine was 1.2 on discharge. #DM Patient's blood sugars were monitored closely during this admission. He initially was very poorly controlled with blood sugars in the mid ___. This was likely due to a delay in restarting his home dose of Lantus 75 units BID (he had been initially placed on 50 units BID). Metformin was held on admission and the patient was placed on a sliding scale short acting insulin in addition to above metformin. Given the patient's need for 2 weeks of prednisone therapy to treat his pericarditis, ___ was consulted to provide input regarding adequate glucose control while on steroids during this time.

The patient had a DES placed to the RCA with LCx disease as well, and course complicated by transient heart block. Following her cath the patient had 2:1 AV block. The patient was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. In the CCU her course was uncomplicated and she was subsequently transferred to the floor for further monitoring. For a brief period her block became more high grade but did evolve to 4:3 block and eventually 1:1 conduction. During her stay we restarted her home metoprolol with good tolerance. We did hold off on starting back her ACEi due to hyperkalemia. #STEMI s\/p DES to RCA: Patient presented with elevated troponin at ___ and upon evaluation at ___ was found to have ECG changes with ST elevation in inferior leads II,III, AVF with lateral anterior depressions. She was taken to the cath lab, loaded with Plavix and ASA, and received a DES to RCA for 100% occlusion. LCx had 80% stenosis and was not intervened upon. CK-MB continued to trend down and the pt was continued on daily ASA, Plavix, and statin and a beta blocker. She was not started on an ACE inhibitor due to borderline hyperkalemia. #AV Block: The patient with 2:1 block in setting of RCA occlusion. EKGs demonstrated prolonged PR with dropped QRS indicating possible second degree type 1 heart block. Her rhythm transitioned to complete heart block, but she remained asymptomatic and normotensive.

A TTE at ___ demonstrated stable ventricular function EF=205. She was not volume overloaded appearing on exam, so home diuretics were held. ___: The patient's baseline Cr. is 1.2 per outside record, was increased to 1.3 on admission. The small increase may be simple due to normal lab variation or from cardiac cath contrast. Creatinine was monitored daily. #Leukocytosis: She also had an elevated WBC on admission, likely in the setting of MI stress induced. There were no signs of infection and the patient remained afebrile. CBC was trended daily. #Elevated LFTs at OSH: AST\/ALT were measured to be 273\/40 in setting of ACS.

ECG without evidence of acute ischemia\/infarction, but serial cardiac biomarkers showed mild new elevation in troponin-T peaking 2 days after chest pain episode. He was started on long-acting nitrate (Imdur 30 mg daily). He did have one chest pain episode in-house which resolved with 1 tab SL TNG. He underwent adenosine nuclear stress test (H\/O intolerance to both Persantine and dobutamine), which showed new severe inferolateral and moderate anterolateral fixed defects, interval worsening moderate inferior wall fixed defect, and global hypokinesis LVEF decreased to 25% (from 35% in ___. Given the absence of objective evidence of a large area of ischemia (rather than prior infarct, as documented) and the small troponin elevation, conservative medical therapy was pursued rather than invasive risk stratification with coronary angiography. He was continued on his home medications: aspirin, metoprolol (at recently increased dose), Lipitor, dabigatran. Plavix was not started given bleeding risk (H\/O radiation proctitis plus admission 6 mos ago for BRBPR). # Chronic systolic heart failure with acute diastolic exacerbation, LVEF 25%: Last TTE in ___ demonstrated moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Pharmacological MIBI showed interval worsening heart failure, LVEF decreased to 25% with increase LV cavity size, all likely due to silent infarcts at home during the intervening ___ years, since MIBI also showed extension of prior infarcts and new infarcts in an LAD distribution. During this admission, he appeared euvolemic for several days, with no evidence ___ or pulmonary edema. He then developed asymmetric ___ edema after receiving small amount IVF on ___ (asymmetry likely due to recent left hip surgery, ___ negative for DVT). This ___ edema was likely dependent edema after being up to a chair for many hours. The patient should have his legs elevated while in bed or sitting in chair and should wear compression stockings. He was continued on home metoprolol. We note that he is not on Lasix or an ACE-I (despite his diabetes and CAD); starting ACE-I as an outpatient should be considered once renal function normalizes (as BP tolerates). # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On Pradaxa for anticoagulation plus metoprolol for rate control, which were continued. HR trended ___, no episodes RVR. # Recent aspiration pneumonia: On admission, patient was midway through a treatment course of levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia, which he completed on ___. CTA chest showed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for aspiration pneumonitis. Patient gave history of feeling he was swallowing his own saliva. Speech and swallow service performed bedside evaluation, suggested patient's diet be restricted to nectar-thickened liquids, soft solids, and pills crushed in applesauce. They also recommended video swallow, which we requested to be performed in rehab. # Chronic kidney disease: Patient has H\/O chronic kidney disease; review of ___ years of creatinine levels show baseline 1.2 - 1.5. Cr was 1.1 on admission; rose to 1.3 by the follow morning (likely due to contrast load received for CTA chest), then normalized thereafter but worsened in the setting of volume overload. Urine lytes showed low urine Na, which could be due to either pre-renal physiology and\/or worsening congestive heart failure, as above. # S\/P left femoral hemi-arthroplasty: Patient had been discharged to rehab for <24 hours. He had previously been hospitalized on the medicine service where he underwent left hemiarthroplasty by ortho for atraumatic (suspected pathologic) left femur fracture, concerning for possible involvement of treated prostate cancer -- pathology returned negative. He worked with ___ during this admission. Ortho follow-up discharge appointments arranged (see below). Patient had repeat hip X-ray here, which was unchanged from prior, no acute fracture. # Incidental Chest CT Finding: Bilateral lung nodules, sclerotic lesions rib and clavicle: Findings noted on CTA chest obtained on admission.

Patient was re-scheduled for heme-onc follow-up including review of pathology from recent intra-operative left femur bone biopsy obtained during last admission. # Depression\/Grief: Patient noted to be suffering from depression and grief over his wife's recently-diagnosed terminal pancreatic cancer. Social work followed during this admission. Psychiatry consulted for repeated expressions of passive suicidality to nursing staff; they felt patient was suffering significantly but was not an imminent threat to himself. Both psychiatry and social work recommended ongoing therapy, which patient accepted only after significant encouragement but seemed to appreciate. He was not interested in pharmacotherapy. Ongoing therapy at rehab and beyond was recommended for coping with his grief. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. Angina - monitor for symptoms, use of SL NG, consider long-acting nitrate dose increase to 60 mg as BP tolerates. 2.

EKG with diffuse TWI in V2-V6 and patient had epigastric pain, severe, but similar to her ___ pain. She had bilateral lower extremity edema and her proBNP was elevated (but lower than during her hospitalization). She responded well to Lasix 40mg IV x 1. Her trops were negative and once she got to the floor her EKG changes actually resolved. Heart catheterization on ___ revealed no significant CAD, but presence of an intramyocardial bridge over the LAD. Her chest pain and EKG changes likely due to coronary vs esophageal vasopasm. We started Imdur 30mg daily on admission, but this was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed that her EF normalized (60%). Her dilitiazem (discontinued on last admission) was restarted on discharge. # ECG Changes \/ Diffuse TWI Her ECG findings are most likely secondary to coronary and\/or esophageal vasospasm. The patient's pain resolved with morphine and had three negative troponins. EKG changes resolved once patient arrived on floor. Imdur 30 mg was added initially for the pain and ECG changes. Cardiac catheterization on ___ showed no significant coronary artery disease but myocardial bridge of LAD. Imdur was discontinued once TTE on ___ showed that her EF normalized (60%) and her dilitiazem (discontinued on last admission) was restarted on discharge. # Stress-induced cardiomyopathy Patient recently discharged with new EF reduction to 35%, thought to be most consistent with a stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient had continued the regimen on which she was recently discharged, including furosemide 20mg daily. She appeared volume overloaded on admission and received IV lasix x1. She was trialed on 40 mg PO lasix daily, however, due to hypotension, this was reduced to prior dose of 20 mg daily. Due to distribution of T-wave changes on EKG, it was thought that her cardiomyopathy may have been ischemic. Cardiac catheterization on ___ showed no significant coronary artery disease but intramyocardial bridge over LAD. Repeat TTE on ___ showed normalization of her EF to 60%. She continued home aspirin and losartan, but metoprolol was discontinued. Previous home diltiazem was restarted on discharge due to normal EF. She was kept on 20 mg furosemide daily, as she likely has component of diastolic heart failure. She did not appear volume overloaded on discharge. # GERD \/ ___ Esophagus Last EGD ___ with diffuse gastritis and evidence of ___. Symptoms on admission were suggestive of esophageal vasospasm, which may account for diffuse TWI. She continued home PPI and was started on imdur 30 mg daily, but this was discontinued on discharge. Home diltiazem (discontinued on previous admission due to depressed EF) was restarted on discharge after TTE revealed normalization of EF to 60%. # Hyponatremia Chronic based on her labs, and at her baseline around 131. Has been previously attributed to SIADH which was again considered during her last hospitalization as her sodium saw no improvement with either fluid administration or diuresis. Sodium remained stable. # Hypertension History of hypertension, previously on diltiazem. This was discontinued after her last hospitalization. She continued her home losartan. Diltiazem restarted on discharge. # COPD: On home O2 since prior hospitalization. Long term smoker. She was started on tiotropium on day of discharge for presumed COPD. She reported that she has outpatient PFTs scheduled. # Anemia, normocytic: Patient with history of normocytic anemia since ___, with baseline HCT between ___. She was previously anemic in ___, but had normal H\/H most recently in ___. Iron studies during this admission were suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation. # Bladder Spasm: She continued home oxybutynin. # Right hip pain Thought to be due to known spinal stenosis and chronic right hip pain. She continued home acetaminophen, lidocaine patches. Transitional Issues: ==================== - patient started on tiotropium for possible COPD; needs outpatient PFTs - patient needs electrolyte check at her PCP appointment on ___ - diltiazem extended release 180 mg daily was restarted on discharge due to resolution of her cardiomyopathy - patient kept on furosemide 20 mg daily as she most likely has some diastolic heart failure - discharge weight: 55 kg","summary":"___ came to the hospital for changes in your EKG. ___ had a heart catheterization that showed no significant blockages in the arteries of your heart, but rather a piece of heart muscle that may compress once of the arteries in your heart. Spasm of this artery may have caused the changes seen on EKG. ___ also had an ultrasound of your heart, which showed dramatic improvement of your heart's pumping function compared to prior."}
